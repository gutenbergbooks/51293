<h2 class="nobreak" id="p-iii" title="Preface.">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="first">The
idea that in the library of nearly every prac­ti­tion­er
in the pro­fes­sions of both Physic and Law there has
been for some time a small gap among the books, which
could be filled by a little work like this now submitted, has
induced the author to prepare and publish the following
pages.</p>
</div>

<p>While it is hoped that this little work will prove of use
to the members of the Legal and Medical Professions, it is
intended to be suggestive rather than exhaustive—a primer
not an encyclopædia; and it is not expected that it will
obviate the necessity for frequent conferences between
physicians and lawyers whenever, in the practice of either,
questions arise requiring the experience of the other.</p>

<p>In most cases the very words of the judges and reporters
have been used, and if any expressions are noticed that
may be deemed over strong it will be found that they are
the words of others: the author’s aim has been rather to
act as an humble compiler and citer of cases, than to
obtrude opinions or theories of his own.</p>

<p>Brief chapters on Dentists and Druggists have been given
because of the intimate connection between these gentlemen
and the members of the medical profession.</p>

<p>With great diffidence this book is committed to the tender
mercies of the critics of these two learned professions—to
those who can so effectually wield the pen, the tongue and
the scalpel.</p>

title="Chapter I. Early Practitioners and Laws.">
<span id="largerblk">THE LAW AND MEDICAL MEN.</span>
CHAPTER I.
<span class="smallerblk">EARLY PRACTITIONERS AND LAWS.</span></h2>

<p class="first">The
first medical practitioners in England, of whom we
have any record, were the Druids: these philosophers,
theologians and soothsayers, also practised medicine and
surgery, and were skilled in anatomy and physic. To add
to the veneration in which they were held, to impress the
ignorant masses with the idea that they had power with
the gods and could prevail, and perhaps to cultivate a belief
in the efficacy of the remedies provided, they mingled
incantations and charms with their medicaments and
nostrums. Their panacea was the mistletoe, cut from the
sacred oak, with a consecrated hook of gold held in holy
hands, on a mysterious night when the propitious beams
of the waxing moon fell upon it; wrapped for a while in a
sanctified cloth and treasured up in the holy of holies of
the woodland god, this strange parasitic growth was deemed
possessed of many virtues and was named All-heal. Two
other herbs, the selago and samolus were also in those days
highly valued for their medicinal efficacy.</p></div>

<p>To every healing herb a divinity was assigned by the
Druids, and the good gods were ever ready to help suffering
<span class="xxpn" id="p002">|2|</span>
humanity against the evil genii who presided over the
poisonous and unwholesome.</p>

<p>These priests also considered the creeping through <i>tolmens</i>
(or perforated stones) good for many diseases. Their best
charm, however, was the anguineum, or snake’s egg, produced
(’tis said) from the saliva and frothy sweat of a
cluster of snakes writhing in a tangled mass, tossed in the
air by the fierce hissings of the serpents, and caught ere it
fell to the ground in a clean white cloth. A genuine egg,
though encased in gold, would float against a running
stream and do many another marvel. The Druid seems to
have been a herbalist, a believer in the faith or prayer cure,
as well as a homœopathist, for in taking the diseased plant,
the mistletoe, to cure diseases he anticipated the doctrine of
<i>similia similibus curantur</i>.</p>

<p>Even in those old days, according to Tacitus, there were
female physicians who competed with the practitioners
of the other sex. The wives of the Druids exercised the
calling of sorceresses, causing considerable evil by their
witchcrafts, but caring for warriors wounded in battle.
Later on women seem to have enjoyed a pre-eminence as
physicians and surgeons in England. Thus are we told that
a “Mayd” treated a wounded “Squyre,”</p>

</div></div>

<p>Chirurgery, or surgery—that is manual application—appears
to have been the earliest branch of the healing art.
We are told of a wonderful cure effected upon Queen
Elgiva, whose beauteous face had been mutilated by the
brutal clergy. Many superstitious practices were in the
early days mingled with the operations of the surgeons, as
well as of the physicians. History speaks of a man the
muscles of whose legs were drawn up and contracted so as
to defy all the skill of the surgeons, until an angel advised
wheat flour to be boiled in milk, and the limb to be poulticed
with it while warm; then all was well.</p>

<p>From the tenth to the twelfth century the practice of
medicine and surgery, in England, was almost exclusively
in the hands of the monks and clergy. So lucrative did
they find it that many of the monks devoted themselves
entirely to it, to the utter neglect of their religious duties.
This the authorities of the church disapproved of, and
made many attempts to restrain. At last, in 1163, it was
enacted by the Council of Tours that no clergyman or monk
should undertake any bloody operation. From that time
<span class="xxpn" id="p004">|4|</span>
the clerics confined themselves to prescribing medicines,
and the practice of surgery naturally fell into the hands of
the barbers and smiths, who had previously been employed
as assistants and dressers to the ecclesiastical operators.</p>

<p>The smiths soon found that most of the business was
absorbed by the barbers: the latter kept little shops for
cutting hair, shaving, bathing and curing the wounded,
especially about the royal palaces and the houses of the
great: the shops were marked by a striped pole and a basin,
symbols that all the king’s subjects might know where to
apply in time of need; (the fillet around the pole indicating
the ribbon for bandaging the arm in bleeding, and the basin
the vessel to receive the blood). The barbers became so
important that in 1461 the freemen of “The Mystery of
Barbers, using the mystery or faculty of Surgery,” obtained
a charter from Edward IV., and were incorporated under the
name of “The Company of Barbers in London,” and none
were allowed to practise save those admitted by the company.
Although this charter was several times confirmed
by subsequent kings, yet side by side with the regular barber-surgeons
there grew up a body of men who practised pure
surgery, and who actually formed a company, called “The
Surgeons of London.” In 1540, by Act of Parliament, these
rival companies were united and named “The Masters, or
Governors, of the Mystery and Commonalty of the Barbers
and Surgeons of London.”</p>

<p>The third section of this Act, after reciting that persons
using the mystery of surgery oftentimes meddled and took
into their cure and houses people infected with pestilence,
great pox, and other contagious infirmities, and also used
or exercised barbery, as washing, or shaving, or other feats
thereto belonging, “which was very perilous for infecting
the King’s liege people resorting to their shops and houses
and there being washed and shaven,” enacted “that no
<span class="xxpn" id="p005">|5|</span>
manner of person within the City of London, suburbs of
the same and one mile compass of said City of London,
after the feast of the Nativity of Our Lord God then next
coming, using barbery or shaving, or that hereafter shall
use barbery or shaving within the said city, etc., he nor they,
nor none of them, to his, her, or their use, shall occupy any
surgery, letting of blood, or any other thing belonging to
surgery, drawing of teeth only excepted; and furthermore,
in like manner, whosoever that useth the mystery or craft
of surgery within the circuit aforesaid, as long as he shall
fortune to use the said mystery or craft of surgery, shall in
nowise occupy nor exercise the feat or craft of barbery or
shaving, neither by himself, nor by one other for him, to his
or their use; and moreover, that all manner of persons using
surgery for the time being, as well freemen as foreigners,
aliens and strangers within the circuit aforesaid, before the
feast of St. Michael the Archangel, next coming, shall have
an open sign on the street side where they shall fortune to
dwell, that all the King’s liege people there passing by may
know at all times whither to resort for remedies in time of
necessity (<a id="fnanchor-2" href="#fn-2" class="fnanchor">2</a>).”</p>

<p>In 1745 this union of barbers and surgeons was dissolved;
or, apparently, the surgeons ousting the barbers, received a
new name and all the privileges of the old company, with
the exclusive right to practise within London and for seven
miles around. In 1800 the Surgeons’ Company was called
“The Royal College of Surgeons, in London;” and this,
in 1843, was changed to that of “The Royal College of
Surgeons of England.”</p>

<p>In Scotland, at a very early day, the chirurgeons and
barbers were united, and enjoyed many rights and privileges.
In 1505 the “craftes of Surregeury and Barbouris” were
<span class="xxpn" id="p006">|6|</span>
formed into a college or corporation, by the town council of
Edinburgh, and became one of the fourteen incorporated
trades of the city. George the Third erected this corporation
into a Royal College, and now it is known as “The
Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.” In 1599,
James VI., “to avoid the inconvenience caused by
ignorant, unskilled, and unlearned persons, who, under the
colour of chirurgeons, are in the habit of abusing the people
to their pleasure, and of destroying thereby infinite numbers
of his Majesty’s subjects,” incorporated the faculty of
Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow; and gave them jurisdiction
over the City of Glasgow and the adjoining counties.
A recent Act of Parliament has very much shorn the
privileges of this faculty (<a id="fnanchor-3" href="#fn-3" class="fnanchor">3</a>).</p>

<p>In Ireland, the “Fraternity of Barbers and Chirurgeons
of the Guild of S. Mary Magdalene” was incorporated by
Henry II. The apothecaries belonged to this body until
1745, when, with the aid of a statute, they set up for themselves,
as “The Guild of S. Luke,” or “The worshipful
Company of Apothecaries.” In 1784 the regularly educated
surgeons of Dublin became incorporated under the name of
“The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.”</p>

<p>In the twelfth century medicine seems to have been first
studied as a science in England. The Universities enacted
that none should practise physic without passing through
a certain course of study. In the fourteenth century the
degree of Doctor of Physic was by no means uncommon.
For many years physicians were greatly aided in chemistry
and medical science by the discoveries of alchemists, and
the search after the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of
life gave many useful hints to practitioners. Chaucer well
describes a “Doctour of Phisike,” in the Prologue to the
<span class="xxpn" id="p007">|7|</span>
Canterbury Tales, and gives an insight into the state of
medical knowledge in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>In 1421, under Henry V., an Act was prepared, providing
that “no one shall use the mysterie of fysyk, unless he
hath studied it at some university, and is at least a bachelor
in that science. And saying, the sheriff shall inquire
whether any one practises in his county contrary to
this regulation; and if any one so practise fysyk he shall
forfeit £40 and be imprisoned: and any woman who
shall practise fysyk shall incur the same penalty.” But
this appears never to have become law.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until the beginning of the sixteenth
century that modern British medical practice may be said
to have commenced. And in 1511 was passed the first
<span class="xxpn" id="p008">|8|</span>
statute for regulating the medical profession (<a id="fnanchor-4" href="#fn-4" class="fnanchor">4</a>). From
the preamble of this Act we learn that physic and surgery
were then practised by “ignorant persons, who could tell
no letters on the book, and by common artificers, smiths,
weavers, and women, who took upon themselves great
cures, partly using sorcery and witchcraft, partly applying
very noxious medicines to the disease.”</p>

<p>Many years after this, however, were to be found those
who though not “ignorant persons” approved of what
would now be called sorcery, witchcraft and noxious medicines.
Bacon gives the following as infallible cures for the
whooping-cough: let a pie-bald horse breathe on the patient:
give him fried mice, three a day for three days in succession:
pass the sick person nine times under the belly and
over the back of a donkey: feed the patient on currant
cake made by a woman who did not change her name when
she was married: or, hold a toad in the mouth that it may
catch the disease. Burton, the Anatomist, says that an
amulet consisting of a spider in a nut-shell, lapped with
silk, is a cure for ague. Graham, in his “Domestic Medicine,”
prescribes spider’s webs for ague and intermittent
fevers.</p>

<p>By the statute of Henry the profession was for the first
time divided into physicians, surgeons and apothecaries: a
division still kept up in England. It also enacts, under a
penalty, that “no physician or surgeon shall practise in
London, or within seven miles of it, without examination
by the Bishop of London, or the Dean of St. Paul’s, and
four doctors of physic; nor out of the city, or precinct,
but if he be first examined and approved by the bishop of
the diocese, or his vicar-general, calling to them such expert
persons in the same faculty as their discretion shall think
convenient.” Fancy a D.D. sitting in judgment on an
<span class="xxpn" id="p009">|9|</span>
M.D. How orthodox and regular in his attendance at
church would the latter have to be! However, 14 &amp; 15
Henry VIII. cap. 5, vests this power of examination in the
President and Elects of the College of Physicians of London.
This Royal College was founded in 1518 by letters patent
from the king. Power was given to it to make laws for
the government of all men of the faculty of physic in
London and within seven miles, and for the correction of
the physicians within those limits and their medicines: and
none could practise within those limits without a license.
Shortly after an Act of Parliament confirmed this patent
so that none could practise in England without the license
of the college, save graduates of Oxford and Cambridge.
Subsequently Fellows of the college were given power,
together with the warden of the Apothecaries’ Society, to
enter the houses of apothecaries in London, to examine
their wares, drugs and stuffs, and to burn and destroy those
that were defective.</p>

<p>In 1560, by 32 Henry VIII. cap. 40, surgery was
declared a part of physic, and the practice thereof was
thrown open to all of the company or fellowship of physicians
throughout the realm. Not long afterwards the
Parliament of this reforming king seems to have changed
its mind and made a move in the direction of free-trade
in physic, and by 34 &amp; 35 Henry VIII. cap. 8, any man
or woman was permitted to practise to a limited extent.
We fancy we can trace the influence of the sturdy king in
the provisions of this Act, which was entitled, “An Act
that persons being no common surgeons may administer
outward medicines not­with­stand­ing the statute;” the
statute after referring to the Act passed in the third year
of the king’s reign (which imposed penalties upon those
who should practise as physicians or surgeons without
being examined and admitted) goes on to say, “Sithence
the making of which said Act (that of 3 Henry VIII.) the
<span class="xxpn" id="p010">|10|</span>
company and fellowships of surgeons of London, minding
only their own lucres, and nothing the profit or ease of the
diseased or patient, have sued, troubled and vexed divers
honest persons, as well men as women, whom God hath
endued with the knowledge of the nature, kind and operation
of certain herbs, roots and waters, and the using and
ministering of them to such as be pained with customable
diseases, as women’s breasts being sore, a pin and the web
in the eye, uncomes of hands, burnings, scaldings, sore
mouths, the stone, strangury, saucelin, and morphers, and
such other like diseases; and yet the said persons have not
taken anything for their pains or cunning, but have
ministered the same to poor people only, for neighbourhood
and God’s sake, and of pity and charity. And it is now
well-known that the surgeons admitted will do no cure to
any person, but where they shall know to be rewarded with
a greater sum or reward than the cure extendeth unto: for
in case they would minister their cunning unto sore people
unrewarded there should not so many rot and perish to
death, for lack of help of surgery, as daily do; but the
greatest part of surgeons admitted have been much more
to be blamed than those persons that they trouble.” It
further states that “although the most part of the persons
of the said craft of surgery have small cunning, yet they
will take great sums of money and do little therefor, and by
reason thereof they do oftentimes impair and hurt their
patients rather than do them good.” In consideration
whereof and for the ease and health of the king’s poor
subjects, it was enacted that it should be lawful to every
person having knowledge and experience of the nature of
herbs, etc., to practise and minister them without suit or
vexation. (Here is evidence of the existence of herb doctors,
hydropaths and lady physicians in those days.)</p>

<p>Numerous Acts of Parliament have been passed touching
the medical profession since the days of “Bluff King Hal,”
<span class="xxpn" id="p011">|11|</span>
one under James I. to prevent popish recusants practising
physic, or using or exercising the trade or art of an apothecary;
another under William and Mary for exempting
apothecaries from serving as constables or scavengers; another
for exempting spirits and spirituous liquours used by
physicians, &amp;c., in the preparation of medicine from duty,
and others for purposes too numerous to mention. But it
is the Medical Act of 1858, as amended by 22 Vict. cap. 21,
that now governs the practitioners.</p>

<p>In 1681, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh,
was incorporated and power was given of licensing practitioners
and of preventing others practising. In Ireland,
although the idea had been conceived many years before,
it was not until 1654 that a body called “The President
and Fraternity of Physicians” was founded; subsequently
this company was incorporated and powers given to it very
similar to those enjoyed by the London College. Under
the Medical Act, Her Majesty was empowered to change
the name of this institution (which had already enjoyed
several aliases), to that of “The Royal College of Physicians
of Ireland.”</p>

<p>In England and Ireland a third class of medical practitioners
exists, namely, the apothecaries. Prior to the days
of Henry VIII. an apothecary seems to have been the common
name in England for a general practitioner in medicine.
About that time shops began to be established for the exclusive
sale of drugs and medicinal compounds, and those
who kept these shops often took upon them to doctor their
customers. In 1542 Henry’s parliament permitted any
irregular practitioner to administer outward medicines, and
these shopkeepers readily availed themselves of the permission
granted by the Act and pushed the sale of their drugs
and obtained larger prices on account of the advice they gave
with them, and they appropriated exclusively the title of
<span class="xxpn" id="p012">|12|</span>
apothecaries. In 1617 they were incorporated under the
name of “The Master, Wardens and Society of the Art and
Mystery of Apothecaries of the City of London.” About
the beginning of the seventeenth century they began to
prescribe as well as supply medicine; and although the
College of Physicians resisted this poaching on what they
considered their preserves, still early in the eighteenth century
the matter was settled in favor of the apothecaries,
since which time they have been legally recognised as a
branch of the medical profession (<a id="fnanchor-5" href="#fn-5" class="fnanchor">5</a>).</p>

<p>An Act of 1815 now regulates the practice of apothecaries
throughout England and Wales, and no one can act as such
or recover any charges for his services unless he has a certificate
from the Society of Apothecaries. An apothecary is
bound to make up any prescription duly signed by a licensed
physician (<a id="fnanchor-6" href="#fn-6" class="fnanchor">6</a>). Creswell, J., considered an apothecary one
“who professes to judge of internal disease by its symptoms,
and applies himself to cure that disease by medicine.”
And Glenn says that the practice of an apothecary may now
be said to consist in attending and advising patients afflicted
with diseases requiring medical (as distinguished from surgical)
treatment; and prescribing, compounding and supplying
medicines for their cure and relief (<a id="fnanchor-7" href="#fn-7" class="fnanchor">7</a>).</p>

<p>The invention of medicine was generally attributed by
the ancients to the gods, and both in Egypt and Greece
female divinities were intimately connected with the healing
art. Isis not only caused, but cured disease; she discovered—so
it was said—many remedies and as late as
Galen several compounds in the materia medica bore her
name. Hygeia, the daughter of Æsculapius, was deemed
<span class="xxpn" id="p013">|13|</span>
the goddess of health, and Juno presided at accouchments.
These fables show that in the remotest antiquity woman
practised medicine. The laws of Greece, at a later period,
forbad women to practise; thus, also, was it in Rome.
However, 300 years before Christ, Agnodice—a young
Athenian—dared to attend in disguise the schools of medicine
forbidden to her sex. Preserving her incognito, when
her education was finished she soon acquired a lucrative
practice; and eventually her case caused the law against
women to be revoked.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, among Mohammedans, many women
were skilled in attending to the needs of their own sex; and
among the Christians, nuns as well as monks ministered to
bodies as well as souls diseased, practising both surgery
and physic. In Italy, at Salerno, women prepared drugs
and cosmetics, practised among persons of both sexes, took
doctor’s degrees, wrote treatises on medical subjects,
obtained the royal authority to engage in the art, and composed
poems in praise of their science. At the University
of Bologna, as late as 1760, Anna Morandi Manzolini filled
the chair of Anatomy; her reputation was European, and
her lecture-room was frequented by students of all countries—so
great was her skill in delicate dissections, and so
clearly did she demonstrate the wonders of the human
form divine. Dr. Maria delle Donne was professor of
medicine and obstetrics in the same college in 1799; and
many were the lady graduates of the Universities of Padua,
Pavia and Ferrara, as well as Bologna.</p>

<p>In France, the earliest official document extant relative
to the profession (dated 1311) forbids the practice of
surgeons, or female surgeons, who have failed to pass the
required examinations; and an edict of 1352 refers to
female practitioners. In Spain, the Universities of Cordova,
Salamanca and Alcala bestowed doctor’s degrees on
<span class="xxpn" id="p014">|14|</span>
many women. In Germany, also, a number of the fair sex
successfully cultivated the science of medicine, and practised
it, in the last century and in the early part of this.
In England, as has already been seen, in early days women
practised the healing arts. Henry VIII. checked them for
a time, but in his old age, changing his mind on this, as on
almost every other subject, gave them liberty to minister
to the outward and less serious ailments of his people.</p>

<p>Crossing the Atlantic an entry is found, under the date
of March, 1638, which tells a tale. It is this: “Jane
Hawkins, the wife of Richard Hawkins, had liberty till the
beginning of the third month, called May, and the magistrates
(if she did not depart before) to dispose of her: and
in the meantime she is not to meddle in surgery or phisick,
drinks, plaisters or oyles, nor to question matters of religion,
except with the elders for satisfaction (<a id="fnanchor-8" href="#fn-8" class="fnanchor">8</a>).” But now woman
is no longer regarded as too good or too stupid to study
medicine in America; in nearly every State in the Union
she has free access to Medical Colleges (<a id="fnanchor-9" href="#fn-9" class="fnanchor">9</a>). The Council
of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario
admit to registration and practice any person who complies
with their requirements, without regard to sex. And the
Imperial Parliament, by an Act passed in 1876, affirmed
the principle that women are entitled to become registered
practitioners of medicine.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="p015"
title="Chapter II. Fees.">
CHAPTER II.
<span class="smallerblk">FEES.</span></h2>

<p>The Roman Law considered the services of an advocate
and of a physician as strictly honorific; and, as in the Roman
age, practitioners in law and medicine, were usually men of
leisure and wealthy, who did not practise for the sake of a
livelihood, remuneration for their services could not be
recovered in the ordinary way. Although owing to the
Utopian ideas concerning the honour of a liberal profession
then in vogue it was considered that any mention of a
“fee,” or a “salary,” by that name would soil and disgrace
the robe of a practitioner, still it was an established
fiction of the Civil Law that the promise of an <i>honorarium</i>
always accompanied the employment of a professional man,
and that such promise created one of those obligations that
might be enforced by action (<a id="fnanchor-10" href="#fn-10" class="fnanchor">10</a>). The Common Law of England
adopted the theory of the Civil Law as to the high
standing of the profession, but afforded no remedy for the
recovery of the charges. Surgeons and apothecaries were
enabled to recover by law remuneration for their services,
but a physician was presumed to attend his patient for an
<i>honorarium</i> (something left to the honour of the patient to
pay or not to pay), and could not maintain an action for
his fees until the passing of the Medical Act, 1858, put an
end to his anomalous position in this money-making age,
and gave him as free an entrance into the courts of law to
recover compensation for his work and labour, time and
<span class="xxpn" id="p016">|16|</span>
skill bestowed, as the worker in any other path of life.
Before this a physician could not recover even expenses out
of pocket, such as those incurred in travelling to visit a
patient, unless there had been an agreement specially made
to that effect (<a id="fnanchor-11" href="#fn-11" class="fnanchor">11</a>).</p>
</div>
<p>If a physician was a surgeon as well, and attended a case
where the advice of a physician and the aid of a surgeon
were necessary, he could recover the value of his services
as a surgeon but not as a physician (<a id="fnanchor-12" href="#fn-12" class="fnanchor">12</a>).</p>

<p>In England the question sometimes arises, where the
practitioner is only a surgeon, whether he can charge for
attendance as a physician or as an apothecary. It has
been held that typhus fever is not a disease that belongs
to a surgeon’s branch of medicine, and that he cannot
therefore recover for his attendance on a patient suffering
under it. So, too, with regard to consumption and dropsy,
though, in the latter case, he may recover for any work
done for the patient specifically within his practise, such as
puncturation, scarification, bandaging and friction (<a id="fnanchor-13" href="#fn-13" class="fnanchor">13</a>).</p>

<p>At one time it was considered that an apothecary was
not entitled to charges for his attendances, but only for his
medicine: then the law decided that he might charge for
either attendances or medicines, but not for both. Shortly
afterwards Tenterden held that one might recover for
attendance (the charge being reasonable), as well as for
medicine. After that full justice was done to this branch
of the profession, and it was decided that there was no
rule of law, and there certainly is none of morals, to prevent
an apothecary from making distinct charges for
<span class="xxpn" id="p017">|17|</span>
attendances and medicines; but if he charges very high
for his drugs the jury may think the attendances ought
not to be paid for as well (<a id="fnanchor-14" href="#fn-14" class="fnanchor">14</a>).</p>

<p>In Scotland, also, at one time physicians’ fees were
regarded as honoraries, and not recoverable by action except
under a special contract (<a id="fnanchor-15" href="#fn-15" class="fnanchor">15</a>). Neither in the United States
nor in the Colonies have these distinctions been made
between the different branches of the profession, nor has
the principle been adopted that the profession of a
physician is a merely honorary one, and that his services
cannot be charged for (<a id="fnanchor-16" href="#fn-16" class="fnanchor">16</a>).</p>

<p>In England every person registered according to the
Medical Act, 1858, and in Ontario those registered under
the Provincial Act, can practise medicine or surgery, or
medicine and surgery; and can recover in any court
of law, with full costs of suit, reasonable charges for
professional aid, advice, and visits, and the costs of any
medicine or other medical and surgical appliances rendered
or supplied to his patient; but no person is entitled
to recover any such charges in any court of law unless
he can prove upon the trial that he is so registered.
Registration has now become a part of the plaintiff’s
title to recover, which it is imperative upon him to prove.
A copy of the medical register for the time being, purporting
to be printed and published under the direction
of the General Council, is evidence in all courts that the
persons therein specified are registered according to the
provisions of the Medical Act; and the absence of the
name of any person is evidence, until the contrary be made
to appear, that such person is not so registered; and the
contrary may be shown by a certified copy, under the hand
<span class="xxpn" id="p018">|18|</span>
of the registrar, of the entry of the name of such person
on the register (<a id="fnanchor-17" href="#fn-17" class="fnanchor">17</a>). Similar rules are in force in the
various States where Medical Boards have been constituted
by legislative authorities for the purpose of examining
and licensing practitioners, such as Alabama, Delaware,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, New York,
Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Subject to the various statutory enactments, every physician
or surgeon, or any one who chooses to act as such, is entitled
to a reasonable reward for his services and for his medicines.
If there was no express promise to pay when the
services were requested, the law implies one: the broad
principle being, that when a person has bestowed his skill
and labor for the benefit of another, at his request, and
no agreement is made in respect to them, the law raises an
implied promise to pay such compensation as the person
performing the service deserved to have; and when there
is no statutory or other restraint upon the remedy, an
action lies on such promise (<a id="fnanchor-18" href="#fn-18" class="fnanchor">18</a>). The amount, unless settled
by law, is a question for the jury, and in settling that, the
eminence of the practitioner, the wealth of the patient, the
delicacy and difficulty of the operation, as well as the time
and care expended, are to be considered (<a id="fnanchor-19" href="#fn-19" class="fnanchor">19</a>).</p>

<p>The law, as a rule, sets no limitation to fees, provided
they be reasonable. Within this rule a practitioner is
allowed discretionary powers and may charge more or less
according to his own estimate of the value of his services.
No one will pretend to assert that all services are of
equal value, and no one will claim that those who can
<span class="xxpn" id="p019">|19|</span>
render them the most skilfully should receive only the same
reward as those who can render them the least so. A
medical man of great eminence may be considered reasonably
entitled to a larger recompense than one who has not
equal practice, after it has become publicly understood
that he expects a larger fee, inasmuch as the party applying
to him must be taken to have employed him with a
knowledge of this circumstance (<a id="fnanchor-20" href="#fn-20" class="fnanchor">20</a>). But doctors must not
be unreasonable in their charges; as Lord Kenyon remarked,
“Though professional men are entitled to a fair
and liberal compensation for their assistance, there are
certain claims which they affect to set up, which if unreasonable
or improper, it is for the jury to control” (<a id="fnanchor-21" href="#fn-21" class="fnanchor">21</a>).
That a patient is a millionaire does not justify an extortionate
charge. The French rule is to consider the gravity
of the disease as well as the fortune and position of the
patient in settling the remuneration of a physician (<a id="fnanchor-22" href="#fn-22" class="fnanchor">22</a>).</p>

<p>The existence of an epidemic does not authorise the
charging of exorbitant fees (<a id="fnanchor-23" href="#fn-23" class="fnanchor">23</a>).</p>

<p>In some ages and countries the fees payable to medical
practitioners have been fixed by law. In Persia, for instance,
in ancient times the law said that “a physician shall treat
a priest for a pious blessing, or a spell; the master of a
house for a small draught animal; the lord of a district for
a team of four oxen; and if he cure the mistress of a house
a female ass shall be his fee.” (Vendidad Farg. VII.) To
take another instance, the medical men in attendance upon
the old princes of Wales had their fees settled; for curing
a slight wound, a surgeon received for payment the clothes
of the injured person which had been stained with blood;
<span class="xxpn" id="p020">|20|</span>
and for curing a dangerous wound he had, in addition to
the bloody clothing, board and lodging while in attendance,
and 180 pence. In Egypt, according to Herodotus, practitioners
were paid out of the public treasury, although they
might also receive fees from their patients.</p>

<p>A medical man can also recover for the services rendered
by his assistants or students; and that even though the assistant
is unregistered (<a id="fnanchor-24" href="#fn-24" class="fnanchor">24</a>). It is not necessary that there
should be any agreed specified price, he will be allowed
what is usual and reasonable (<a id="fnanchor-25" href="#fn-25" class="fnanchor">25</a>).</p>

<p>The right of a medical man to recover his charges for
professional services does not depend upon his effecting a
cure, or on his services being successful, unless there is a
special agreement to that effect. It does not depend upon
the fortune of the case whether it be good or bad, but upon
the skill, diligence and attention bestowed. For, as a
general rule, a physician does not guarantee the success of
his treatment; he knows that that depends upon a higher
power. Still, some good must have resulted from his
efforts. The rule appears to be that if there has been
no beneficial service there shall be no pay; but if some
benefit has been derived, though not to the extent
expected, this shall go to the amount of the plaintiff’s
demand, leaving the defendant to his action for negligence (<a id="fnanchor-26" href="#fn-26" class="fnanchor">26</a>).
The practitioner must be prepared to show
that his work was properly done, if that be disputed, in
order to prove that he is entitled to his reward (<a id="fnanchor-27" href="#fn-27" class="fnanchor">27</a>). Where
the surgical implements employed in amputating an arm
were a large butcher knife and a carpenter’s sash-saw, it
was held that the Court rightly charged the jury, that if the
<span class="xxpn" id="p021">|21|</span>
operation was of service, and the patient did well and recovered,
the surgeon was entitled to compensation, though it
was not performed with the highest degree of skill, or might
have been performed more skilfully by others (<a id="fnanchor-28" href="#fn-28" class="fnanchor">28</a>).</p>

<p>If a surgeon has performed an operation which might
have been useful but has merely failed in the event, he is
nevertheless, entitled to charge; but, if it could not have
been useful in any event, he will have no claim on the
patient (<a id="fnanchor-29" href="#fn-29" class="fnanchor">29</a>). A medical man who has made a patient undergo
a course of treatment which plainly could be of no service,
cannot make it a subject of charge; but an apothecary who
has simply administered medicines under the direction of a
physician may recover for the same, however improper they
may have been (<a id="fnanchor-30" href="#fn-30" class="fnanchor">30</a>). If the physician has employed the ordinary
degree of skill required of one in his profession, and
has applied remedies fitted to the complaint and calculated
to do good in general, he is entitled to his fees, although
he may have failed in this particular instance, such failure
being then attributable to some vice or peculiarity in the
constitution of the patient, for which the medical man is not
responsible (<a id="fnanchor-31" href="#fn-31" class="fnanchor">31</a>).</p>

<p>It is the duty of a physician who is attending a
patient infected with a contagious disease, when called
upon to attend others not so infected, to take all such precautionary
means experience has proved to be necessary
to prevent its communication to them. When a
physician who was told by a patient not to attend any
infected with small-pox or his services would be dispensed
with, failed to say that he was attending such a patient, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p022">|22|</span>
promised not to do so, but continued to attend, and did by
want of proper care communicate small-pox to the plaintiff
and his family, it was held that these facts were proper
evidence to go to the jury in reduction of damages in an
action for his account, and that the physician was responsible
in damages for the suffering, loss of time and damage
to which the plaintiff may have been subjected. If a physician
by communicating an infectious disease has rendered
a prolonged attendance necessary, thereby increasing his
bill, he cannot recover for such additional services necessitated
by his own want of care (<a id="fnanchor-32" href="#fn-32" class="fnanchor">32</a>). This rule will apply with
equal force to puerperal fever (<a id="fnanchor-33" href="#fn-33" class="fnanchor">33</a>).</p>

<p>In the case of vaccination, the physician, while he does
not guarantee the specific value of the vaccine virus, yet
guarantees its freshness; so that if he inoculate a patient
with virus in an altered state, constituting as it then would
mere putrid animal matter, and erysipelas or any injury to
any limb necessitating amputation should arise, he will
undoubtedly be held responsible for the suffering, loss of
time, and permanent injury to the patient (<a id="fnanchor-34" href="#fn-34" class="fnanchor">34</a>). Long since
Lord Kenyon was of the opinion that if a surgeon was sent
for to extract a thorn, which might be pulled out with a
pair of nippers, and through his misconduct it became
necessary to amputate the limb, the surgeon could not
come into a court of justice to recover fees for the cure of
the wound which he himself had caused (<a id="fnanchor-35" href="#fn-35" class="fnanchor">35</a>).</p>

<p>The physician when sending in his bill should be specific
in his charges and not general; he should give the number
of visits and dates. In one case a lump charge of “$13 for
medicine and attendance on one of the general’s daughters
<span class="xxpn" id="p023">|23|</span>
in curing the whooping cough,” being objected to by the
valiant officer, was held by the Court to be too loose to
sustain an action (<a id="fnanchor-36" href="#fn-36" class="fnanchor">36</a>). Where a practitioner brought an
action for a bill consisting of a great number of items, and
gave evidence as to some of them only, and the jury gave a
verdict for the whole amount of the bill, the Court refused
to interfere and grant a new trial because every item was
not proved (<a id="fnanchor-37" href="#fn-37" class="fnanchor">37</a>). Where a medical man delivered his bill
to a patient without a specific charge, leaving a blank for
his attendance, the Court inferred that he considered
his demand in the light of a “<i>quiddam honorarium</i>,” (this
was before the Medical Act), and intended to leave it to
the generosity of the patient, and the latter having paid
into court a certain amount, the Court held the surgeon
was bound by the amount so paid and could not recover
any more (<a id="fnanchor-38" href="#fn-38" class="fnanchor">38</a>). As a rule, however, if a doctor’s bill is
not paid when presented he is not limited by it to the
amount of his claim, if he can show that his services were
of greater value (<a id="fnanchor-39" href="#fn-39" class="fnanchor">39</a>). When witnesses are called to speak
as to the value of the practitioner’s services the Courts
generally incline towards the lowest estimate (<a id="fnanchor-40" href="#fn-40" class="fnanchor">40</a>).</p>

<p>The number of visits required must depend on each particular
case, and the physician is deemed the best and
proper judge of the necessity of frequent visits; and in the
absence of proof to the contrary, the Court will presume
that all the professional visits made were deemed necessary
and were properly made (<a id="fnanchor-41" href="#fn-41" class="fnanchor">41</a>). There must not be too many
<i>consultations</i>; and the physician called in for consultation
or to perform an operation may recover his fees from the
<span class="xxpn" id="p024">|24|</span>
patient, not­with­stand­ing that the attending practitioner
summoned him for his own benefit and had arranged with
the patient that he himself would pay (<a id="fnanchor-42" href="#fn-42" class="fnanchor">42</a>).</p>

<p>Where a medical man has attended as a friend, he cannot
charge for his visits. This was held in one case where
it was proved that the practitioner had attended the patient
as a friend, upon the understanding that he was to have
refreshments and dinners free of charge; and in another
case, where a medical man had attended professionally, for
several years, a lady with whom he was on terms of intimacy
(but received no fees, except once, when he had prescribed
for her servant). The day before her death this lady had
written to her executors, asking them to remunerate the
doctor in a handsome manner, and moreover in her will she
gave him a legacy of £3,000 and a reversionary interest in
£6000 more. It was proved that he had attended others
without having taken fees or sent in bills. It was held
that his services had been tendered as for a friend, and
accepted as a friends, and his demand as a debt against the
assets of the lady was rejected (<a id="fnanchor-43" href="#fn-43" class="fnanchor">43</a>). One would have
thought that the physician in this latter case should have
been satisfied.</p>

<p>Where a tariff of fees has been prepared, and agreed to
by the physicians in any locality, they are bound by it
legally as far as the public is concerned, morally as far as
they themselves are concerned (<a id="fnanchor-44" href="#fn-44" class="fnanchor">44</a>). It is no part of the
physicians business to supply the patient with drugs; if
he does so he has a right to be reimbursed therefor (<a id="fnanchor-45" href="#fn-45" class="fnanchor">45</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p025">|25|</span></p>

<p>If a physician enters into a special contract to perform
a cure he will be held strictly to its terms, nor will he be
allowed to plead circumstances, which, under the general
law of professional obligation, might fairly exonerate him
from blame, for failing of success in the treatment of his
patient. To promise an absolute cure is to assume arrogantly
the possession of powers never delegated to man;
only a weak and vapid intellect will commit so egregious a
blunder. Yet, if a man choose to do it he may, and having
entered into an <i>express</i> contract he will be held liable for
its fulfilment. For it is his own fault if he undertake a
thing above his strength. If the agreement is, no cure, no
pay: he cannot even recover for medicines supplied if the
cure is not effected. At least, so it was held at Vermont.
Contracts to receive a certain sum contingent upon the
performance of a cure have always been considered as
professionally immoral, and in the civil law were repudiated
as against public policy (<a id="fnanchor-46" href="#fn-46" class="fnanchor">46</a>).</p>

<p>The physician is always allowed discretionary powers
over the patient entrusted to his care in modes of treatment,
so as to be able to alter them according to the varying
necessities of the case. Unless such change of treatment
involves a risk of life or consequences of which he is
unwilling to assume the responsibility, he is not under
obligation to give notice or obtain permission before making
it. Particularly is this the case where the patient is not at
home or among friends or relatives, but is in some degree
in his custody and under his exclusive supervision, as well
as care. In such circumstances he is authorised to perform
operations, or change his treatment, or enforce discipline
essential to its fulfilment, without first consulting or
obtaining permission from friends or guardians at a distance,
since delay might involve a greater risk to the health
<span class="xxpn" id="p026">|26|</span>
and possibly the life of the patient than would a necessitated
operation; and of such things he alone is the
proper, as he alone can be the best, judge. He may
recover his fees for such operation or change of treatment
without proving that it was necessary or proper,
or that before he performed it he gave notice to the
party who had to pay, or that it would have been dangerous
to have waited until such notice had been given.
The burden of proving unskilfulness or carelessness in the
operation lies upon the party objecting to it (<a id="fnanchor-47" href="#fn-47" class="fnanchor">47</a>).</p>

<p>When a medical man is called as a witness before a
court, to testify as to facts within his knowledge, he must
attend and give evidence upon payment of the same fees
as other witnesses are entitled to; unless it is otherwise
provided by statute.</p>

<p>Where a statute provides that a medical man should be
paid a certain witness fee, he is entitled to that fee although
he be not called to give professional evidence, and it is not
necessary to prove that he is in practice (<a id="fnanchor-48" href="#fn-48" class="fnanchor">48</a>). A witness
should be paid his fees when he is subpœnaed; but even
if he attends he can refuse to give evidence until he
is paid, unless he takes the oath before making the objection (<a id="fnanchor-49" href="#fn-49" class="fnanchor">49</a>).
A subpœna should be served a reasonable time
before the trial, to enable a witness to put his affairs in
such order that his attendance on the court may be as
little detrimental as possible to his interests (<a id="fnanchor-50" href="#fn-50" class="fnanchor">50</a>).</p>

<p>Where a medical man is summoned to attend a coroner’s
inquest, unless the statute law is clearly to the contrary,
<span class="xxpn" id="p027">|27|</span>
he is only entitled to be paid for each days attendance, not
for each body on which the inquest was held (<a id="fnanchor-51" href="#fn-51" class="fnanchor">51</a>).</p>

<p>Under the Ontario Act, R. S. cap. 79, a coroner, if he finds
that the deceased was attended during his last illness, or at
his death, by a duly qualified medical man, may summon
that medical man to attend the inquest; if he finds that
he was not so attended, he may summons any legally
qualified neighbouring practitioner, and may direct him to
hold a post-mortem examination; but a second practitioner
will not be entitled to any fees, unless a majority of the
jury have, in writing, asked him to be called (<a id="fnanchor-52" href="#fn-52" class="fnanchor">52</a>). The
fees are, for attendance without <i>post-mortem</i> $5, if with
<i>post-mortem</i>, without an analysis of the contents of the
stomach or intestines, $10; if with such analysis, $20;
together with a mileage each way of twenty cents. If the
practitioner when duly summoned fails to attend, without
sufficient reason, he is liable to a penalty of $40 (<a id="fnanchor-53" href="#fn-53" class="fnanchor">53</a>).</p>

<p>Is an expert witness entitled to receive greater compensation
than an ordinary witness? or can he be compelled
to give a professional opinion without being paid for it?
The States of Iowa, North Carolina and Rhode Island have
answered these questions by statutes which say such witnesses
shall be entitled to extra compensation to be fixed
by the court, in its discretion: while Indiana says experts
may be compelled to appear and testify to opinions without
payment or tender of compensation other than the <i>per diem</i>
and mileage allowed by law to other witnesses (<a id="fnanchor-54" href="#fn-54" class="fnanchor">54</a>).</p>

<p>The subject does not appear to have been very much
considered in England. In a case, at <i>Nisi Prius</i>, Lord
<span class="xxpn" id="p028">|28|</span>
Campbell declared that an expert was not bound to attend
upon being served with a subpœna, and that he ought not
to be subpœnaed; that he could not be compelled to attend
to speak merely to matters of opinion (<a id="fnanchor-55" href="#fn-55" class="fnanchor">55</a>). And Mr. Justice
Maule, where an expert demanded additional compensation,
said there was a distinction between a witness to facts and
a witness selected by a party to give his opinion on a
subject with which he is peculiarly conversant from his
employment in life. The former is bound as a matter of
public duty to testify as to all facts within his knowledge,
the latter is under no such obligation, and the party who
selects him must pay him for his time before he will be
compelled to give evidence (<a id="fnanchor-56" href="#fn-56" class="fnanchor">56</a>).</p>

<p>Worden, J., of the Supreme Court of Indiana, in considering
the question, in a case that came up prior to the
statute above referred to, reviewed most of the American
decisions and the opinions of the text writers, and concluded
“that physicians and surgeons, whose opinions are valuable
to them as a source of their income and livelihood, cannot
be compelled to perform service by giving such opinions in
a court of justice without payment.” The Court further
said, “It would seem, on general principles, that the knowledge
and learning of a physician should be regarded as his
property, which ought not to be extorted from him in the
form of opinions without just compensation.” “If the
professional services of a lawyer cannot be required in a
civil or criminal case without compensation, how can the
professional services of a physician be thus required? Is
not his medical knowledge his capital stock? Are his
professional services more at the mercy of the public than
the services of a lawyer? When a physician testifies as an
expert by giving his opinion, he is performing a strictly
<span class="xxpn" id="p029">|29|</span>
professional service. *&#160;*&#160;* The position of a medical
witness testifying as an expert is much more like that of a
lawyer than that of an ordinary witness testifying to facts.
The purpose of this service is not to prove facts in the
cause, but to aid the Court or Jury in arriving at a proper
conclusion from facts otherwise proved” (<a id="fnanchor-57" href="#fn-57" class="fnanchor">57</a>). In an earlier
case (in 1854), in Massachusetts, the Court said, “to
compel a person to attend because he is accomplished in a
particular science, art or profession, would subject the same
individual to be called upon in every case in which any
question in his department of knowledge is to be solved.
Thus, the most eminent physician might be compelled,
merely for the ordinary witness fees, to attend from the
remotest part of the district, and give his opinion in every
trial in which a medical question should arise. This is so
unreasonable that nothing but necessity can justify it” (<a id="fnanchor-58" href="#fn-58" class="fnanchor">58</a>).</p>

<p>On a trial for murder the prosecution had procured
the attendance of Dr. Hammond to testify professionally,
and had agreed to give him $500 as his fee. This fee was
complained of as an irregularity, but the Court in delivering
judgment remarked, “The district attorney, it is true,
might have required the attendance of Dr. H. on subpœna,
but that would not have sufficed to qualify him as an expert
with clearness and certainty upon the questions involved.
He would have met the requirements of the subpœna if he
had appeared in court when he was required to testify and
given impromptu answers to such questions as might have
been put to him. He could not have been required, under
process of subpœna, to examine the case, and to have used
his skill and knowledge to enable him to give an opinion
upon any points of the case, nor to have attended during
the whole trial and attentively considered and carefully
<span class="xxpn" id="p030">|30|</span>
heard all the testimony given on both sides, in order to
qualify him to give a deliberate opinion upon such testimony,
as an expert, in respect to the question of the sanity
of the prisoner;” and held “that there was no irregularity
in the payment of such a fee” (<a id="fnanchor-59" href="#fn-59" class="fnanchor">59</a>).</p>

<p>Such text writers of high repute as Taylor, Phillips,
Redfield and Ordronaux, all agree that an expert cannot be
compelled to give professional opinions without proper
remuneration. The last named writer says, “Where a
subpœna is served upon an expert he must obey it, if within
the range of physical possibility. But once on the stand
as a skilled witness his obligation to the public ceases, and
he stands in the position of any professional man consulted
in relation to a subject upon which his opinion is sought.
He cannot be compelled to bestow his skill and professional
experience gratuitously; whoever calls for an opinion from
him in chief must pay him, and the expert may decline to
answer until the party calling him has paid. When he has
given his evidence he cannot decline repeating it, or explaining
it. A similar rule will, by parity of reasoning, apply to
personal services demanded from the expert, as well as to
opinions asked” (<a id="fnanchor-60" href="#fn-60" class="fnanchor">60</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Alabama, in
1875 (<a id="fnanchor-61" href="#fn-61" class="fnanchor">61</a>), confirmed a fine imposed upon a physician for
refusing to state the nature and character of a wound
received by a man and its probable effect, upon the ground
that he had not been remunerated for his professional
opinion, nor had compensation for it been promised or
secured. And the Court of Appeals in Texas, in 1879, held,
that the court could compel a physician to testify as to the
<span class="xxpn" id="p031">|31|</span>
result of a post-mortem examination; adding, that a medical
expert could not be compelled to make a post-mortem
examination unless paid for it, but an examination having
already been made by him he could be obliged to disclose the
results thereof (<a id="fnanchor-62" href="#fn-62" class="fnanchor">62</a>).</p>

<p>The result of the authorities seems to be that, without
the aid of a statute, an expert cannot be compelled to
bestow his skill and professional experience gratuitously
upon any party, for his skill and experience are his individual
capital and property.</p>

CHAPTER III.
<span class="smallerblk">
WHO SHOULD PAY THE DOCTOR.</span></h2>

<p>If Smith says to Brown, a medical man, “Attend upon
Robinson, and if he does not pay you I will;” that being a
promise to answer for a debt of Robinson’s, for which he is
also liable, the guarantee is only a collateral undertaking,
and, under the Statute of Frauds, must be in writing and
signed by Smith, or some other person thereunto by him
lawfully authorised, in order to be binding upon him. But
if Smith says to Dr. Brown, absolutely and unqualifiedly,
“Attend upon Robinson, and charge your bill to me,” or
“I will pay you for your attendance upon Robinson;” then
the whole credit being given to Smith, no written agreement
is necessary to enable the doctor to recover the amount of
his account from him, since it is absolutely the debt of
Smith (<a id="fnanchor-63" href="#fn-63" class="fnanchor">63</a>).</p>
</div>
<p>Where a person calls at the office of a physician, and, he
being absent, the visitor leaves his business card with these
words written on it, “Call on Mrs. Jones, at No. 769 High
Street,” handing it to the clerk in attendance, with the request
that he would give it to the doctor and tell him to
go as soon as possible; this caller becomes liable to pay
the doctor’s bill for attendance upon Mrs. Jones in pursuance
of such message. Yet Mrs. Jones, if a widow, may
also be liable; for one who acquiesces in the employment
of a physician, and implies, by his or her conduct, that the
doctor is attending at his or her request, is responsible for
<span class="xxpn" id="p033">|33|</span>
the value of his services. If Mrs. Jones is living with her
husband, or, without her fault, away from him, the doctor
has still another string to his bow, and may recover the
amount of his bill from Mr. Jones; for the rule is, that a
husband must pay his wife’s doctor’s bills. Of course the
doctor cannot make all three pay (<a id="fnanchor-64" href="#fn-64" class="fnanchor">64</a>).</p>

<p>Long since, Park, J., was clearly of the opinion that if a
mere stranger directed a surgeon to attend a poor man,
such person was clearly liable to pay the surgeon (<a id="fnanchor-65" href="#fn-65" class="fnanchor">65</a>). Yet,
in some cases in the United States, it has been held that
the man who merely calls the doctor is not bound to pay
him. When, for instance, in Pennsylvania, a son of full
age, when living with his father, fell sick, and the father
went for the doctor, urging him to visit his son. Afterwards
the physician sued the parent. The Court said this
was wrong, that he should have sued the son, as the father
went as a messenger only, that the son, who had the
benefit of the services, was the responsible person; and
remarked that it was clear that had the defendant been a
stranger, however urgent he may have been and whatever
opinions the physician may have formed as to his liability, he
would not have been chargeable without an express promise
to pay, as, for instance, in the case of an inn-keeper or any
other individual whose guest may receive the aid of medical
service. A different principle, the Court considered, would
be very pernicious, as but very few would be willing to
run the risk of calling in the aid of a physician where
the patient was a stranger or of doubtful ability to pay.
This was in 1835 (<a id="fnanchor-66" href="#fn-66" class="fnanchor">66</a>). And, in Vermont, one brother
took another, who was insane, to a private lunatic asylum
and asked that he (the insane one), might be taken in and
<span class="xxpn" id="p034">|34|</span>
cared for. This was done. In course of time the doctor
sued the sane one for his bill, but the Court would not aid
him in the matter, saying, “He is not liable unless he
promised to pay” (<a id="fnanchor-67" href="#fn-67" class="fnanchor">67</a>).</p>

<p>In the case of Mr. Dodge, above referred to, the Court
said, “He might very readily have screened himself from
all liability, by simply writing the memorandum on a blank
card, or by adding to that which he wrote on his own card
something that would have apprised the doctor of the
fact that he acted in the matter for Mrs. Jones, as her
agent.”</p>

<p>The reporter did not approve of this decision, and so
appended the following graphic note: “Let us see how this
thing works. We will take as an illustration an almost
every-day occurrence arising in the country. A. B. is taken
suddenly and seriously ill in the night time, and sends to
his neighbour, C. D. living in the next house to his, to have
him go after the doctor as soon as he can, for he is in great
pain and distress. C. D. jumps out of bed without hesitation,
and hastily dresses himself, and goes out to his barn
and takes a horse from the stable, and not waiting to put
on a saddle or bridle, jumps on to the horse with the halter
only, puts him at full speed for the doctor’s office, some
two or three miles distant. On arriving there he finds the
doctor absent from home, but his clerk is there, and C. D.
at once says, ‘Tell the doctor to call on A. B. who has been
taken suddenly sick; tell him to come as soon as possible.’
In accordance with this message the doctor calls upon A. B.,
and prescribes for and attends him professionally for
several days. After a reasonable time the doctor sends in
his bill to A. B. and it not being paid as soon as the doctor
desires, he calls on C. D. and requests him to pay the bill.
C. D. with perfect astonishment, asks why he is to pay.
<span class="xxpn" id="p035">|35|</span>
The doctor informs him that he made himself liable to pay
the bill because, when he delivered the message, he did not
tell the clerk that he came for the doctor by the request of
A. B. nor that he acted as agent of A. B. in delivering his
message. Well, says C. D. the fact was I did go at the
request of A. B. and merely acted as his agent in delivering
the message, and I will swear to these facts if necessary.
The doctor insists that it will do him no good if he should
give such testimony, for the law is settled on that point, as
just such a case has recently been decided in New York
under just such a state of facts, where the jury, in the
justice court, found a verdict for the doctor for the amount
of his bill, and, on appeal by the defendant to the general
term of the New York Common Pleas, that court unanimously
sustained the verdict of the jury, and affirmed the
judgment of the court below. Well, says C. D. ‘If that is
the law I think I will wait awhile before I go after a doctor
again as an act of neighbourly kindness.’” This case was
decided as late as March, 1873.</p>

<p>A wife has implied authority to bind her husband for
reasonable expense incurred in obtaining medicines and
medical attendance during illness; but this implied authority
is put an end to if she commits adultery while living apart
from her husband, and there has been no subsequent condonation;
or, if she leaves her husband’s home of her own
accord and without sufficient reason, and the fact has
become notorious, or the husband has given sufficient notice
that he will no longer be responsible for any debts that she
may incur (<a id="fnanchor-68" href="#fn-68" class="fnanchor">68</a>). If a husband turn an innocent wife out
of doors without the means of obtaining necessaries, it is a
presumption of law, which cannot be rebutted by evidence,
that she was turned out with the authority of her husband
to pledge his credit for necessaries, and in such a case
<span class="xxpn" id="p036">|36|</span>
medical attendance will be considered as one of the
primary necessaries (<a id="fnanchor-69" href="#fn-69" class="fnanchor">69</a>). A married woman’s misconduct
does not exonerate the husband from paying a doctor whom
he requests to attend her (<a id="fnanchor-70" href="#fn-70" class="fnanchor">70</a>).</p>

<p>Although the law requires the husband to furnish the
wife with all necessaries suitable to his condition in life,
including medical attendance in case of sickness, still it gives
him the right to procure these necessaries himself and to
decide from whom and from what place they are to come.
If a physician attends a wife whom he knows to be living
separate and apart from her husband, he ought to enquire
whether she has good cause for so doing; for if she has not
he cannot make the husband pay the bill; and it has been
held that it devolves upon the doctor to show that there
was sufficient cause for the wife’s separation (<a id="fnanchor-71" href="#fn-71" class="fnanchor">71</a>). The
employment of a physician by a husband to attend his sick
wife, presumably continues throughout the illness; and the
mere fact that the wife is removed, with the husband’s
consent, from his home to her father’s, will not enable him
to resist payment of the doctor’s bill for visits paid to her
at the father’s  (<a id="fnanchor-72" href="#fn-72" class="fnanchor">72</a>).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the law’s desire not to favour any
particular school, a quack’s bill was thrown out where
the services were rendered without the husband’s assent.
This was done in a case where a doctor was in the habit of
putting a woman into a mesmeric sleep, she thereupon
became a clairvoyant and prescribed the medicines which
the doctor furnished, and for these he sued. The Judge
said:—“The law does not recognize the dreams, visions or
revelations of a woman in mesmeric sleep as necessaries for
<span class="xxpn" id="p037">|37|</span>
a wife for which the husband, without his consent, can be
made to pay. These are fancy articles which those who
have money of their own to dispose of may purchase if they
think proper, but they are not necessaries known to the law
for which the wife can pledge the credit of the absent
husband”  (<a id="fnanchor-73" href="#fn-73" class="fnanchor">73</a>).</p>

<p>In England, it was, until 1869, considered that a parent’s
duty to furnish necessaries for an infant child was a moral
and not a legal one, so that he was not liable to pay for
medicines or medical aid furnished to his child without
some proof of a contract on his part either expressed or
implied. And this still is the view where the child is over
fourteen. The rule of law varies in the different States of
the Union. In most of those in which the question has
come before the courts the legal liability of the parent for
necessaries furnished to the infant is asserted, unless they
are otherwise supplied by the father; and it is put upon the
ground that the moral obligation is a legal one, and some
of the courts have declared this quite strongly. In other
States the old English rule has been held to be law, and
agency and authority have been declared to be the only ground
of such liability. The authority of the infant to bind the
parent for medical aid supplied him will be inferred from
very slight evidence (<a id="fnanchor-74" href="#fn-74" class="fnanchor">74</a>). But a contract to pay will not be
implied when the infant has been allowed a sufficiently
reasonable sum for his expenses (<a id="fnanchor-75" href="#fn-75" class="fnanchor">75</a>). Where the services
have been rendered with the parent’s knowledge and consent,
he will generally have to pay for them. A boy left
home against his father’s will, and refused to return at his
parent’s command. Being seized with a mortal illness he did
at last come back. His father went with him to a
<span class="xxpn" id="p038">|38|</span>
physician to obtain medical advice, and the doctor afterwards
visited him professionally at his father’s house. No express
promise to pay was proved, nor had the father said he
would not pay. The Court held the father liable to pay the
doctor’s bill (<a id="fnanchor-76" href="#fn-76" class="fnanchor">76</a>). And in an English case, where a father
had several of his children living at a distance from his own
house under the protection of servants, it was held that
if an accident happened to one of the children he was liable
to pay for the medical attendance on such child, although
he might not know the surgeon called in, and although the
accident might have been received through the carelessness
of a servant (<a id="fnanchor-77" href="#fn-77" class="fnanchor">77</a>).</p>

<p>By a recent English statute (<a id="fnanchor-78" href="#fn-78" class="fnanchor">78</a>), when any parent shall
wilfully neglect to provide adequate food, clothing, medical
aid, or lodging for his child, in his custody, under the age
of fourteen, whereby the child’s health shall have been, or
shall be likely to be, seriously injured, he shall be guilty of
an indictable offence punishable by imprisonment. Charles
Downes was the two-year-old child of a member of the
sect of Peculiar People. These people never call in medical
aid or give medicines: to do so would be contrary to their
religious opinions; but if any is sick they call in the elders
of the church, who pray over him, anointing him with oil in
the name of the Lord; then they hope for a cure, as they
have thus literally complied with the directions in the 14th
and 15th verses of the 5th chapter of the Epistle of St. James.
This child was ill for months; the usual course was pursued
by his father; no medical aid was obtained, although easily
obtainable. The illness was misunderstood, and, although
he was taken care of and well supplied with food, the child
died. The father was indicted for manslaughter, and the
<span class="xxpn" id="p039">|39|</span>
jury found that the death was caused by the neglect to
obtain medical assistance, that the father <i>bona fide</i> (though
erroneously) believed that medical aid was not required,
and that it was wrong to use it. The Judge entered a
verdict of guilty, and the Court held—under this statute—that
a positive duty was imposed upon the father to provide
adequate medical aid when necessary, whatever his conscientious
scruples might be, and that that duty having been
wilfully neglected by the prisoner, and death having ensued
from that neglect, he was properly convicted of manslaughter (<a id="fnanchor-79" href="#fn-79" class="fnanchor">79</a>).</p>

<p>It had been held by Pigott, B., in a case against these
same Peculiar People, and also by Willis, J., that, at common
law, there was no legal duty upon a father to employ a
physician for his sick child (<a id="fnanchor-80" href="#fn-80" class="fnanchor">80</a>).</p>

<p>It is not enough to shew neglect of reasonable means for
preserving or prolonging the child’s life, to convict of manslaughter,
it must be shewn that the neglect had the effect
of shortening life. It will not do merely to prove that
proper medical aid might have saved or prolonged life and
would have increased the chance of recovery, but that it
might have been of no avail (<a id="fnanchor-81" href="#fn-81" class="fnanchor">81</a>). In this case the father,
perhaps, might have been convicted of neglect of duty
as a parent, under the statute (per Stephen, J.).</p>

<p>Medicines and medical aid are necessaries for which an
infant may legally contract, and for which he can render
himself liable. In Massachusetts, it was held that he would
not be liable merely because his father was poor and unable
to pay (<a id="fnanchor-82" href="#fn-82" class="fnanchor">82</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p040">|40|</span></p>

<p>A master is not bound to provide medical assistance for
his servant, but the obligation, if it exists at all, must arise
from contract; nor will such a contract be implied simply
because the servant is living under the master’s roof, nor
because the illness of the servant has arisen from an accident
met with in the master’s service (<a id="fnanchor-83" href="#fn-83" class="fnanchor">83</a>). But where a
servant left in charge of her master’s children was made ill
by suckling one of the children, and called in a medical
man to attend her, with the knowledge and without the
disapprobation of her mistress, it was decided that the
doctor could make the father and master pay (<a id="fnanchor-84" href="#fn-84" class="fnanchor">84</a>). And a
master is bound to provide an apprentice with proper medicines
and medical attendance (<a id="fnanchor-85" href="#fn-85" class="fnanchor">85</a>).</p>

<p>In England, when a pauper meets with an accident, the
parish where it occurs is usually liable for the surgeon’s
bill. If, however, the illness of the pauper arises from any
other cause than accident or sudden calamity, the parish in
which he is settled is under legal liability to supply him with
medical aid, although he may be residing in another parish.
But all these questions with regard to paupers are determined
according to the poor laws of the different countries (<a id="fnanchor-86" href="#fn-86" class="fnanchor">86</a>).</p>

<p>It has frequently happened that when a railway passenger
or employee has been injured by a collision or
accident, and some railway official has called in a doctor,
the company has afterwards refused to pay the bill; and
the courts have declined to make them do so, unless
it be shown that the agent or servant who summoned the
medical man had authority to do so. It has been
held that neither a guard, nor the superintendent of a
station, nor the engineer of the train in which the accident
happened, had any implied authority, as incidental
<span class="xxpn" id="p041">|41|</span>
to their positions, to render their companies liable for
medical services so rendered (<a id="fnanchor-87" href="#fn-87" class="fnanchor">87</a>). The Court of Exchequer
said, “It is not to be supposed that the result of their
decision will be prejudicial to railway travellers who may
happen to be injured. It will rarely occur that the surgeon
will not have a remedy against his patient, who, if he be
rich, must at all events pay; and if poor, the sufferer will
be entitled to a compensation from the company, if they by
their servants have been guilty of a breach of duty, out of
which he will be able to pay, for the surgeon’s bill is always
allowed for in damages. There will, therefore, be little
mischief to the interests of the passengers, little to the
benevolent surgeons who give their services.” But, in
England, it has been decided that the general manager of a
railway company has, as incidental to his employment,
authority to bind his company for medical services bestowed
upon one injured on his railway. In Illinois, a similar
decision was given as to a general superintendent, although
in New York judgment was given the other way (<a id="fnanchor-88" href="#fn-88" class="fnanchor">88</a>).</p>

<p>If an accident happen to a stage coach by which a passenger’s
leg is broken, or his human form divine is otherwise
injured, the coachman has no authority to bind his master
by a contract with a surgeon to attend to the injury; nor
if a lamp-lighter, by neglect, burn any person, has he, or
any officers of the gas company, power to bind the company
by a contract for the cure of the injured person (<a id="fnanchor-89" href="#fn-89" class="fnanchor">89</a>). If
ordinary employees had such authority, then every servant
who, by his negligence or misconduct, had caused injury to
an individual, would have an implied authority to employ,
on behalf and at the expense of his employer, any person he
thought fit to remedy the mischief.</p>

title="Chapter IV. Who May Practise.">
CHAPTER IV. <span class="smallerblk">
WHO MAY PRACTISE.</span></h2>

<p>The law has nothing to do with the merits of particular
systems or schools of medicine. Their relative merits may
become the subject of inquiry when the skill or ability of a
practitioner, in any given case, is to be passed upon as a
matter of fact. But the law does not and cannot supply
any positive rules for the interpretation of medical science.
It is not one of those certain or exact sciences in which
truths become established and fixed, but it is essentially progressive
in its nature. No one system of practice has been
uniformly followed, but physicians, from the days of Hippocrates,
have been divided into opposing sects and schools.
The sects of the dogmatists and the empirics divided the
ancient world for centuries until the rise of the methodics,
who in their turn gave way to innumerable sects. Theories
of practice believed to be infallible in one age have been
utterly rejected in another. For thirteen centuries Europe
yielded to the authority of Galen. He was implicitly followed,
his practice strictly pursued. Everything that
seemed to conflict with his precepts was rejected; and yet,
in the revolutions of medical opinion, the works of this
undoubtedly great man were publicly burned by Paracelsus
and his disciples; and for centuries following the medical
world was divided between the Galenists and the chemists,
until a complete ascendancy over both was obtained by the
vitalists. This state of things has been occasioned by the
circumstance that medical practitioners have often been
more given to the formation of theories upon the nature of
<span class="xxpn" id="p043">|43|</span>
disease and the mode of its treatment, than to that careful
observation and patient accumulation of facts by which, in
other sciences, the phenomena of nature have been unravelled.
*&#160;*&#160;* It is not to be overlooked that as an art
it has been characterised in a greater degree by fluctuations
of opinion as to its principles and the mode of its practice
than perhaps any other pursuit. That it has been distinguished
by the constant promulgation and explosion of
theories. That it has alternated between the advancement
of new doctrines and the revival of old ones; and that its
professors in every age have been noted for the tenacity
with which they have clung to opinions, and the unanimity
with which they have resisted the introduction of valuable
discoveries. They still continue to disagree in respect to
the treatment of diseases as old as the human race; and
at the present day *&#160;*&#160;* a radical and fundamental
difference divides the allopathists from the followers of
Hahnemann, to say nothing of those who believe in the sovereign
instrumentality. *&#160;*&#160;* The axiom that doctors
differ is as true now as ever it was (<a id="fnanchor-90" href="#fn-90" class="fnanchor">90</a>). Thus spake Daly,
J.; the reporter observes in a note: “It may, perhaps, be
safely questioned whether the sister sciences of law and
theology present any such unity or certainty of opinion as
might enable them to arraign the medical profession.”</p>
</div>

<p>In Great Britain and Ireland, since the passing of the
Medical Act of 1858, every one registered under the
provisions of that Act is entitled, according to his qualification,
to practise medicine or surgery, or both (as the
case may be), in any part of Her Majesty’s Dominions,
and to recover on any court of law (should any patient
neglect to pay) his reasonable charges for professional aid,
advice and visits, and the costs of any medicine, or other
medical or surgical appliances rendered or supplied by
<span class="xxpn" id="p044">|44|</span>
him to his patient; but any one not so registered cannot
recover any such charges in any court of law. Proof of
registration is absolutely necessary for a recovery; but it
will suffice if the registration has taken place before the
trial (<a id="fnanchor-91" href="#fn-91" class="fnanchor">91</a>).</p>

<p>And as to who may be registered; the Act says any one
may be who is a fellow, member, licentiate, or extra licentiate,
of the Royal College of Physicians of London, or of
the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, or of the
King and Queen’s College of Ireland; or fellow, member,
or licentiate in midwifery, of the Royal College of Surgeons
of England, or fellow or licentiate of the Royal College of
Surgeons of Edinburgh, or of the Faculty of Physicians and
Surgeons of Glasgow, or of the Society of Apothecaries,
London, or of the Apothecaries Hall, Dublin; or doctor,
bachelor, or licentiate of medicine, of any university of the
United Kingdom, or licentiate in surgery of any university
in Ireland; or doctor of medicine by doctorate granted prior
to August, 1858, by the Archbishop of Canterbury; or doctor
of medicine of any foreign or colonial college, after
examination, or who satisfies the Council of Education and
Registration that there is sufficient reason for admitting
him to be registered (<a id="fnanchor-92" href="#fn-92" class="fnanchor">92</a>).</p>

<p>In France, the medical profession is divided into two
grades; in the higher grade are all doctors of medicine of
the universities; those in the lower grade are <i>officiers de
santé</i>. In Germany, the right to practise is conferred by a
state licence granted on passing the <i>staats-examen</i>: the
degree of doctor of medicine is almost always taken at some
university after obtaining the state license. In Austria, the
<span class="xxpn" id="p045">|45|</span>
right to practise is carried by the degree of doctor of
medicine obtained from a university (<a id="fnanchor-93" href="#fn-93" class="fnanchor">93</a>).</p>

<p>The legislature of every colony of Great Britain has full
power to make laws for the purpose of enforcing the
registration within its jurisdiction of medical practitioners,
including those registered under the Imperial Act.</p>

<p>In Ontario, the medical profession is incorporated under
the name and style of “The College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Ontario,” and every person registered under
the provisions of the Ontario Medical Act (<a id="fnanchor-94" href="#fn-94" class="fnanchor">94</a>) is a member
of the college. There is a “Council,” in part appointed by
certain educational institutions, in part elected by practitioners.
This council fixes the curriculum of studies,
appoints examiners, and arranges the examinations of those
desirous of admission to practise; it also arranges for the
registration of those who pass the examinations, or had
certain qualifications before July, 1870. Every one who passes
the examinations and has complied with the rules and
regulations of the council, and paid his fees, is entitled to
registration, and by virtue thereof to practise medicine,
surgery and midwifery in the Province. If registration is
not granted to one he may compel it by a writ of mandamus (<a id="fnanchor-95" href="#fn-95" class="fnanchor">95</a>).</p>

<p>Registration is essential to entitle a practitioner to recover
any charges for medical or surgical advice, or for attendance,
or for performance of any operation, or for any
medicine he may have prescribed or supplied. (This last
clause does not apply to any licensed chemist or druggist.)
And if any one unregistered, for hire, gain or hope of reward,
practises or professes to practise medicine, surgery or
midwifery, or advertises to give advice therein, he is liable
<span class="xxpn" id="p046">|46|</span>
to a fine of from $25 to $100. And any one not registered
who takes or uses any name, title, addition or description
implying or calculated to lead people to infer that
he is registered, or that he is recognized by law as a
physician, surgeon, accoucheur, or a licentiate in medicine,
surgery or midwifery, is liable to the same penalty. Any
person who wilfully or falsely pretends to be a physician,
doctor of medicine, surgeon, or general practitioner, or
assumes any title, addition or description, other than he
actually possesses and is legally entitled to, is liable to a
fine of from $10 to $50. But it is not punishable to
practise for love or charity, and any one who has the degree
of doctor of medicine may place the letters “M.D.” after
his name, even though he is not a registered practitioner, if
he do not act as such for hire or gain (<a id="fnanchor-96" href="#fn-96" class="fnanchor">96</a>).</p>

<p>Where one partner was registered and the other was not,
and there was painted on the sign after the name of the
first “M.D., M. C. P. &amp; S., Ont.,” and after the name of
the other only “M.D.,” it was held that the use of the simple
letters “M.D.,” in con­tra­dis­tinc­tion to the full titles of the
partner on the same sign was not the use of a title “calculated
to lead people to infer registration,” and that the
unregistered partner was not guilty of an offence under the
act (<a id="fnanchor-97" href="#fn-97" class="fnanchor">97</a>).</p>

<p>In Ontario, provision is made for the registration of
Homœopathists as well as of regular practitioners, and for
the Eclectics who were practising in the Province for six
years before 1874.</p>

<p>A physician practising in another country, and performing
medical services for a patient then residing there, may
recover his fees in this Province not­with­stand­ing he is not
<span class="xxpn" id="p047">|47|</span>
registered (<a id="fnanchor-98" href="#fn-98" class="fnanchor">98</a>). A medical practitioner duly registered in
England, under the Imperial Act, is entitled in Ontario to
registration upon payment of fees without examination (<a id="fnanchor-99" href="#fn-99" class="fnanchor">99</a>).</p>

<p>In the United States, the common law doctrine, which
favours the right of every man to practise in any profession
or business in which he is competent, prevails to a great
extent; and medicine being regarded by it as an honorific
profession, no apprenticeship was required, but the practitioner
always prescribed at his peril. This was also the
doctrine of the civil law, which drew no barriers around
either law or medicine. Any one who pleased might practise
them without any previous qualification; subject always
to responsibility for injury inflicted upon others.</p>

<p>In the absence of any statutes, therefore, limiting the
common law right to practise medicine inherent in every
person, the term physician may there be applied to any one
who publicly announces himself to be a practitioner of the
art and undertakes to treat the sick, either for or without
reward. The common law knows nothing of systems or
schools of medicine. In its eyes, Eclectic, Botanic, Physio-Medical,
Electrical, Thompsonian, Homœopath, Reformed,
Indian Doctor, Cancer Doctor, Indianopathist, Clairvoyant
Doctor and regular physician are alike. The scales of justice
are no more affected by the large doses of the allopathist
than by the infinitesimal supplies of the homœopathist.
But the law will sometimes interfere where one not pretending
to be a practising physician uses a peculiar system
in his own family. A father, during the sickness of his
children and wife, refused to provide any medical treatment,
except that applied by himself, called the Baunscheidt system,
which consists in pricking the skin of the patient in
different parts of the body with an instrument armed with
<span class="xxpn" id="p048">|48|</span>
a number of needles and operated by a spring, and then
rubbing the parts affected with an irritating oil. The wife
and three children had died within a month. The man practised
the exanthematic treatment upon them, but did not
even call in physicians who used that mode. The Superior
Court of Pennsylvania deprived this believer in the Baunscheidt
panacea of the custody of his surviving children (<a id="fnanchor-100" href="#fn-100" class="fnanchor">100</a>).</p>

<p>Before the common law every one undertaking to treat
the sick professionally, and as the exercise of his vocation,
is legally a physician. He has the rights of one, and when
he assumes those rights the law lays upon him the heavy
burdens and res­pons­i­bil­i­ties of the profession. It is, of
course, far otherwise if any statute prescribes particular
qualifications for the practice of the profession and one
undertakes to discharge its duties without such qualifications.
Then he is doubly a wrong-doer; first, as against
the statute; and, second, as against the public, who have a
right to demand in him the ordinary proficiency of his profession (<a id="fnanchor-101" href="#fn-101" class="fnanchor">101</a>).</p>

<p>In Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Kentucky, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New
Jersey, Texas and Vermont, there appear to be no statutory
requirements regulating the practice of physicians or
surgeons. In Virginia, the practitioner only needs a
license. In Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine,
Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin, a practitioner must either
have a license from a medical board or society, constituted
according to the law of the respective States, or else be a
graduate of a medical college. In South Carolina and the
District of Columbia, he must be licensed by the medical
board; so, too, in Delaware. But this rule in Delaware
does not apply to those who practise exclusively the
<span class="xxpn" id="p049">|49|</span>
Thompsonian or botanic, or homœopathic systems; or practise
gratuitously or for what is willingly given them.</p>

<p>In New York State, early in the century, it was enacted
that no one practising physic or surgery, without a license,
could collect any debts incurred by such practice, and it was
a penal offence so to practise. In 1830, the unauthorized
practice of physic or surgery was made a misdemeanor
punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both. Shortly
afterwards the offence was made penal instead of criminal,
and it was declared the provisions should not extend to any
one using or applying for the benefit of any sick person
any roots, barks, or herbs, the growth or produce of the
United States. In 1844, all laws limiting the right to
practise medicine or surgery were repealed; free trade in
physic prevailed; all examinations, certificates and licenses
were declared unnecessary; the repealing Act expressly
permitted any person to practise physic subject to punishment,
as for a misdemeanor, if he should be convicted of
gross ignorance, malpractice, or immoral conduct. However,
a change came, and, in 1874, the legislature declared that it
was “a misdemeanor for any person to practise medicine or
surgery in the State of New York, unless authorized so to
do by a license or diploma from some chartered school,
State board of medical examiners, or medical society,” or
to practise under cover of a medical diploma illegally
obtained. The penalty for the first offence is a fine of not
more than $200; for a subsequent offence a fine of from
$100 to $500, or imprisonment for not less than thirty days,
or both (<a id="fnanchor-102" href="#fn-102" class="fnanchor">102</a>). In 1880, it was further enacted that no person
shall “practise physic or surgery within the State unless he
is twenty-one years of age, and has been heretofore authorized
so to do pursuant to the laws in force at the time of
his authorization, or is hereafter authorized so to do, either
by license from the regents of the University of the State
<span class="xxpn" id="p050">|50|</span>
of New York, a diploma of an incorporated medical college
within the State, or of one without the State approved of
by some proper medical faculty within the State.” Every
physician or surgeon, except those who had been practising
ten years before 1880 (and a few others), had to register with
the clerk of the county, where he practised, his name,
residence, place of birth, together with his authority to
practise.</p>

<p>After the repeal of the old Medical Acts, and before the
enactment of the law of 1874, the New York Court of
Common Pleas had to define who was a physician or doctor,
and it said the words simply meant, “a person who made
it his business to practise physic; and it was wholly
immaterial to what school of medicine he belonged, or
whether he belonged to any. The legal signification of the
term doctor means simply a practitioner of physic. The
system pursued is immaterial. The law has nothing to do
with the merits of particular systems.” The point came up
in considering a case where an agreement of employment
between an opera director and a vocalist provided for the
forfeiture of a month’s salary in case the latter should fail
to attend at any stated performance, except in the case of
sickness, certified to by a doctor to be appointed by the
director. The director appointed Dr. Quin, an homœopathist.
Signor Corsi, the baritone, had a bad cold and a
sore throat, but would not consult Dr. Quin, and proffered
a certificate of an allopathist of his own choosing. This
Max Maretzek would not take, and he refused to pay Corsi
his salary. The singer sued, but the Court held that the
provision was binding upon the artist, although the director
had appointed a person in the practice of what is known as
the homœopathic system of medicine. *&#160;*&#160;* The
Court considered it was error to attempt in the then present
state of medical science to recognize as a matter of law
any one system of practice, or to declare that the
<span class="xxpn" id="p051">|51|</span>
practitioner who follows a particular system is a doctor, and that
one who pursues a different method is not (<a id="fnanchor-103" href="#fn-103" class="fnanchor">103</a>).</p>

<p>It has been held, however, that where a “regular physician”
is spoken of, an allopathic is meant (<a id="fnanchor-104" href="#fn-104" class="fnanchor">104</a>).</p>

<p>In Iowa, the Court said, “As yet there is no particular
system of medicine established or favoured by the laws of
Iowa, and as no system is upheld none is prohibited. The
regular, the botanic, the homœopathic, the hydropathic and
other modes are alike unprohibited. Though the regular
system has been advancing as a science for centuries, aided
by research and experiment, by experience and skill, still
the law regards it with no partiality or distinguishing favour,
nor is it recognized as the exclusive standard or test by
which the other systems are to be adjudged” (<a id="fnanchor-105" href="#fn-105" class="fnanchor">105</a>).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the New York law of 1874, one can
undertake to effect cures by manipulation without possessing
a diploma. He may even maintain an action for the compensation
agreed upon, although not a graduate and having
no license to practise. A man professed to cure by rubbing,
kneading and pressing the body. The court considered his
system was rather one of nursing than of either medicine or
surgery, and that it could not result in any injury to the
person practised upon than that of possible financial loss (<a id="fnanchor-106" href="#fn-106" class="fnanchor">106</a>).
Yet, in Maine, where a license is required, even a “medical
clairvoyant” was held to come within the statute, and it
was decided that he could not render his professional services
without having the legal permission. In England, an
unregistered person sued to recover his charges for galvanic
operations, and for materials and electric fluid used therein.
The jury decided in favour of the galvanizer, and the court
<span class="xxpn" id="p052">|52|</span>
would not disturb the verdict, as the work was done before
the Act of 1858 came into operation, but expressed a strong
opinion that if the work had not been done when it was, it
would have been impossible to hold that the case did not
fall within the statute (<a id="fnanchor-107" href="#fn-107" class="fnanchor">107</a>).</p>

<p>A physician must practise according to the principles of
his school. There are distinct and different schools of practice;
allopathic or old school, homœopathic, Thompsonian,
hydropathic or water cure; and if a physician of one of
those schools is called in, his treatment is to be tested by
the general doctrines of his school, not by those of other
schools. It is presumed that patient and physician both
understand this (<a id="fnanchor-108" href="#fn-108" class="fnanchor">108</a>).</p>

<p>A person professing to follow one system of medical
treatment cannot be expected by his employer to practise
another. While the regular physician is expected to follow
the rules of the old school in the art of curing, the botanic
physician must be equally expected to adhere to his adopted
method. While on the part of every medical practitioner
the law implies an undertaking that he will use an ordinary
degree of care and skill in medical operations, and he is
unquestionably liable for gross carelessness or unskilfulness
in the management of his patients, still the person who
employs a botanic practitioner has no right to expect the
same kind of treatment or the same kind of medicine that
a regular physician would administer. The law does not
require a man to accomplish more than he undertakes, nor
in a different manner from what he professes. So, if one is
employed as a botanic physician, and performs his services
with ordinary care and skill, in accordance with the system
he professes to follow, that will be regarded as a legal defence
to a suit for malpractice. It would show a full
<span class="xxpn" id="p053">|53|</span>
compliance with his profession and undertaking, and if injury
resulted to the plaintiff he could blame no one but himself (<a id="fnanchor-109" href="#fn-109" class="fnanchor">109</a>).</p>

<p>If a patient has not been deluded by any but himself,
and voluntarily employs in one art a man who openly
exercises another, his folly has no claim to indulgence.
The old Mahomedan case, cited by Puffendorf with
approbation, is very much to the point. A man who had a
disorder in his eyes called on a farrier for a remedy. This
worthy gave him a remedy commonly used by his quadrupedal
patients. The man lost his sight, and brought an
action against the farrier for damages; but the Judge said
that no action would lie, for, if the complainant had not
himself been an ass, he would never have employed a horse
doctor. But when a case, the converse of this, came up, the
Court remarked that, “stock and the human family are
animals with many similitudes and some variances; so that,
although it be admitted that one acquainted with the mode of
treating diseases of the human family should not be relied
on to select from the materia medica substances apt for the
treatment of stock, still we think it clear that one having a
scientific knowledge of the diseases of men must be presumed
to have so much knowledge of the diseases of a mule
as to enable him to determine whether a disease with
which the animal is afflicted be of recent or long standing.
An expert in the diseases of man is necessarily an expert
in the diseases of animals, so as to make his opinion
competent evidence upon a matter in reference to which
he will swear that his scientific knowledge has enabled him
to form an opinion.” And so a physician was allowed to
give his opinion as to whether the disease with which a
mule was afflicted was, or was not, of long standing, as he
considered himself competent so to do from his knowledge
<span class="xxpn" id="p054">|54|</span>
of the diseases to which human flesh is heir, although he
knew nothing in particular about the diseases of stock (<a id="fnanchor-110" href="#fn-110" class="fnanchor">110</a>).</p>

<p>As one who employs a homœopathic or botanic physician
knowingly cannot object to his bill because he was not
treated in the way usual among orthodox practitioners; so,
on the other hand, if a physician of one school is employed
by one who has a <i>penchant</i> for that particular system, and
treats his patient according to a different system, he cannot
recover for his services if he fail to benefit the patient (<a id="fnanchor-111" href="#fn-111" class="fnanchor">111</a>).</p>

<p>Proof that one practises physic is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of
his professional character; and if one holds himself out
as a physician and surgeon, and acts as such, the law will
hold him liable as such (<a id="fnanchor-112" href="#fn-112" class="fnanchor">112</a>).</p>

<p>A physician who merely casually makes up a prescription
for a friend when meeting him upon the street, cannot be
called his medical attendant; that term means one to
whose care a sick person has been confided (<a id="fnanchor-113" href="#fn-113" class="fnanchor">113</a>).</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="p055"
title="Chapter V. Negligence and Malpractice.">
CHAPTER V.
<span class="smallerblk">NEGLIGENCE AND MALPRACTICE.</span></h2>

<p>Malpractice, or <i>mala praxis</i>, may be defined to be an
improper discharge of professional duties, either through
want of skill or negligence. It is now more particularly
applied to torts—when committed by a physician, surgeon,
or apothecary.</p></div>

<p>It is a great misdemeanor and offence at common law,
whether it arise from curiosity and experiment, or from
neglect; because it breaks the trust which the party has
placed in the physician, tending directly to his destruction (<a id="fnanchor-114" href="#fn-114" class="fnanchor">114</a>).
A medical man who is guilty of gross negligence,
or evinces a gross ignorance of his profession, is criminally
responsible for the consequences. And one who, by a
culpable want of care and attention, or by the absence of a
competent degree of skill and knowledge, causes injury to a
patient, is liable to a civil action for damages; unless,
indeed, such injury be the immediate result of intervening
negligence on the part of the patient himself; or unless such
patient has by his own carelessness directly conduced to
such injury (<a id="fnanchor-115" href="#fn-115" class="fnanchor">115</a>).</p>

<p>It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between civil and
criminal malpractice, or to say when one is criminally, and
when only civilly responsible. But it may be said generally,
that to constitute criminal liability there must be such a
<span class="xxpn" id="p056">|56|</span>
degree of complete negligence in the practice as the law
means by the word felonious (<a id="fnanchor-116" href="#fn-116" class="fnanchor">116</a>).</p>

<p>There may be malpractice by commission, <i>i. e.</i>, from the
want of ordinary skill in the discharge of professional duties;
or malpractice by omission, <i>i. e.</i>, from negligence in the
discharge of such duties.</p>

<p>The question, “Was there negligence?” will be answered
from the stand point of the law, not from that of medicine,
when a matter comes to be judicially investigated. The
law as applicable to other professions and occupations will
be applied to the medical or surgical case under consideration.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the term <i>negligence</i> is limited in its
application to carelessness in the performance of professional
duty; <i>carelessness</i> is its proper synonyme. Duties
performed without care, caution, attention, diligence, skill,
prudence, or judgment, are negligently performed. Acts
are so designated which are performed by one heedlessly,
even when there is no purpose to omit the performance of
duty. It is <i>non-feasance</i>, not malfeasance. It is the
omitting to do, and not the ill-doing—it is the leaving
undone what one ought to have done—not the doing what
one ought not to have done—this last being a want of skill.
In its various degrees it ranges between simple accident and
actual fraud, the latter beginning where negligence ends (<a id="fnanchor-117" href="#fn-117" class="fnanchor">117</a>).</p>

<p>Wharton, after criticising various definitions, proposes this,
“Negligence, in its civil relations, is such an inadvertent
imperfection, by a responsible human agent, in the discharge
of a legal duty, as immediately produces, in an ordinary
and natural sequence, a damage to another” (<a id="fnanchor-118" href="#fn-118" class="fnanchor">118</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p057">|57|</span>
Negligence, in medical practice, is a violation of the obligation
that medical men impliedly enter into when they accept
the charge of a patient; such obligation enjoins care and
caution in what they do, and in what they omit to do. A
medical man is liable as well for want of skill, as for
negligence, and an injured party may bring his action to
recover for damage resulting from ignorance and carelessness,
and recover on proving that he sustained damage from
either (<a id="fnanchor-119" href="#fn-119" class="fnanchor">119</a>).</p>

<p>Physicians and surgeons have specified duties imposed
upon them when they undertake the charge of a patient.
Refusing to perform their part of the implied contract will
constitute negligence, and for all injury resulting therefrom
they will be held accountable. It will constitute a
tort for which the law gives damages (<a id="fnanchor-120" href="#fn-120" class="fnanchor">120</a>). Of course a
medical man, unless he be an officer of the Government,
charged with specific duties which he thereby violates, has
a legal right to decline to take charge of a particular case.
When in charge, however, he is liable for any negligence,
whether of omission or commission, which may produce
injury to his patient. <i>Voluntatis est suscipere mandatum,
necessitas est consummare</i> (<a id="fnanchor-121" href="#fn-121" class="fnanchor">121</a>).</p>

<p>There is an implied obligation on a man holding himself
out to the community as a physician and surgeon, and
practising his profession, that he should possess the ordinary
skill requisite for reasonable success, and that he should
attend to the case with due care (<a id="fnanchor-122" href="#fn-122" class="fnanchor">122</a>). If the patient knows
of the practitioner’s want of skill, he cannot complain of
the lack of that which he knew did not exist.
<span class="xxpn" id="p058">|58|</span></p>

<p>A surgeon does not become an actual insurer (<a id="fnanchor-123" href="#fn-123" class="fnanchor">123</a>); the
implied contract is not to cure, but to possess and employ in
the treatment of the case such reasonable skill and diligence
as are ordinarily exercised by thoroughly educated surgeons;
and in judging of the degree of skill and attention required,
regard is to be had to the time and place. The law implies
that in the treatment of all cases which they undertake
medical men will exercise reasonable and ordinary care and
diligence; they are bound always to use their best skill and
judgment in determining the nature of the malady and the
best mode of treatment, and in all respects to do their best
to secure a perfect restoration of their patients to health
and soundness. But they do not impliedly warrant the
recovery of their patients, and are not liable on account of
any failure in that respect, unless it is through some
default of their own (<a id="fnanchor-124" href="#fn-124" class="fnanchor">124</a>). Tindal, C.J., in summing up to the
jury in an action for improper treatment to a hand and
wrist, whereby the plaintiff lost the use of her hand, well
said, “Every person who enters into a learned profession
undertakes to bring to the exercise of it a reasonable degree
of care and skill. He does not undertake, if he is a surgeon,
that he will perform a cure, nor does he undertake to use
the highest possible degree of skill. There may be persons
who have higher education and greater advantages than he
has, but he undertakes to bring a fair, reasonable and
competent degree of skill.”</p>

<p>Wharton and Stillé thus state the law: “A physician
and surgeon is only responsible for ordinary skill, etc., and
for the exercise of his best judgment in matters of doubt.
He is not accountable for a want of the highest degree of
skill (<a id="fnanchor-125" href="#fn-125" class="fnanchor">125</a>), nor for an erroneous, though honest conclusion,
<span class="xxpn" id="p059">|59|</span>
according to his best light (<a id="fnanchor-126" href="#fn-126" class="fnanchor">126</a>). The law has no allowance
for quackery. It demands qualification in the profession
practised, not extraordinary skill such as belongs to few men
of rare genius and endowment, but that degree which ordinarily
characterizes the profession. And in determining
whether the practitioner possesses ordinary skill, regard
must be had to the advanced state of the profession at the
time (<a id="fnanchor-127" href="#fn-127" class="fnanchor">127</a>).</p>

<p>As to what is ordinary or reasonable skill or care, the
rule has sometimes been laid down thus favourably, “The
least amount of skill with which a fair proportion of the
practitioners of a given locality are endowed, is to be taken
as the criterion by which to judge the physician’s skill or
ability” (<a id="fnanchor-128" href="#fn-128" class="fnanchor">128</a>). Or, as another writer puts it, “It has been
finally determined to consider the least amount of skill
compatible with a scientific knowledge of the healing art
as sufficient to predicate the existence of ordinary skill” (<a id="fnanchor-129" href="#fn-129" class="fnanchor">129</a>).
To render a medical man liable even civilly for negligence,
or want of due care or skill, it is not enough that there has
been a less degree of skill than some other medical man
may have shown, or a less degree of care than even he
himself might have bestowed, nor is it enough that he
himself acknowledges some degree of want of care; there
must have been a want of competent and ordinary care and
skill, and to such a degree as to have led to a bad
result (<a id="fnanchor-130" href="#fn-130" class="fnanchor">130</a>).</p>

<p>In a city there are many means of professional culture
which are inaccessible in the country. Hospitals can be
walked, libraries visited, new books and appliances bought,
<span class="xxpn" id="p060">|60|</span>
constant intercourse had with the greater lights of the
profession. What is due diligence, therefore, in the city, is not
due diligence in the country; and what is due diligence in
the country is not due diligence in the city. Hence, the
question, in each particular case, is to be determined, not by
enquiring what would be the average diligence or skill of
the profession (which would be a thing very difficult to
reach), but what would be the diligence or skill of an honest,
intelligent and responsible practitioner in the position in
which the one in question was placed (<a id="fnanchor-131" href="#fn-131" class="fnanchor">131</a>).</p>

<p>The skill required is not an <i>absolute</i> but a <i>relative</i> qualification;
and as such, therefore, always subordinated to
whatever conventional standard of professional proficiency
we may choose to adopt. Like morals, it may vary with
times and places, or, if based upon representative intellects,
it is clear that the ideal type selected must be one to which the
majority, rather than the minority, of minds approximate (<a id="fnanchor-132" href="#fn-132" class="fnanchor">132</a>).
A physician, when called upon to manage a case, is not
required to apply the skill and care which could be applied
by the perfect ideal physician, for the reason that from the
limitation of the human intellect no perfect ideal physician
exists in practice, and, from the limitation of human
endurance, no perfect ideal physician, even if he existed,
could watch a patient unin­ter­mit­ting­ly. But a physician,
when called upon to manage a case, is bound to exercise the
skill and vigilance which good and faithful physicians, under
the circumstances in which he is placed, would exercise. If
called upon in a country town, remote from the great
centres of scientific activity, to attend to an exceptional case
which requires immediate action, he is not liable if he does
not employ those mechanisms which only a residence in
such a centre of scientific activity would enable him to
procure. On the other hand, a physician living in such a
<span class="xxpn" id="p061">|61|</span>
centre is liable for negligence, if, when called upon in such
a case, he does not use such mechanism, supposing its
application to be advisable (<a id="fnanchor-133" href="#fn-133" class="fnanchor">133</a>).</p>

<p>A physician and surgeon is bound to possess the ordinary
skill, learning and experience of his profession generally
at the time in similar localities, and with similar opportunities
for experience (<a id="fnanchor-134" href="#fn-134" class="fnanchor">134</a>).</p>

<p>A patient is entitled to the benefit of the increased
knowledge of the day. The physician or surgeon who
assumes to exercise the healing art is bound to be up to
the improvements of the day. The standard of ordinary
skill is on the advance; and he who would not be found
wanting must apply himself with all diligence to the most
accredited sources of knowledge (<a id="fnanchor-135" href="#fn-135" class="fnanchor">135</a>).</p>

<p>Sex is no excuse for negligence; there is no rule of law
to the effect that less care is required of a woman than a
man. A lady physician cannot as such claim any privilege
of exemption from the care and caution required of men,
any more than a woman acting as a locomotive engineer
could be allowed to use less diligence to avoid mischief to
others than men must use. Male and female are governed
by the same rule in this respect: the rule of prudent regard
for the rights of others knows nothing of sex (<a id="fnanchor-136" href="#fn-136" class="fnanchor">136</a>).
Inasmuch as gratuitous services are more generally rendered
by young and inexperienced physicians than by those
who are well established in their business, a presumption
naturally arises that one who renders such services is not
possessed of great skill, and was not supposed to be by the
patient. This presumption may be overcome by proof to
the contrary; and the physician must be judged by the
<span class="xxpn" id="p062">|62|</span>
standard to which he led the patient to believe he had
attained; or, if he has done nothing to mislead his patient
upon this point, his responsibility will be measured by the
degree of skill which he is proved actually to possess (<a id="fnanchor-137" href="#fn-137" class="fnanchor">137</a>).</p>

<p>It has been laid down in Maine, that physicians and
surgeons who offer themselves to the public as practitioners
impliedly promise thereby that they possess the requisite
skill and knowledge to enable them to heal such cases
as they undertake with reasonable success; and that this
rule does not require the possession of the highest, or even
the average skill, knowledge and experience, but only such
as will enable them to treat the case understandingly and
safely (<a id="fnanchor-138" href="#fn-138" class="fnanchor">138</a>).</p>

<p>Considering how much the treatment of a case depends
upon its varying phases, which change as quickly as the
shifting hues of the heavens, it is hard for one medical
man to come forward and condemn the treatment of a
brother in the profession, and to say he would have done
this or that, when probably, had he been in a position to
judge of the case from the first, he would have done no
better (<a id="fnanchor-139" href="#fn-139" class="fnanchor">139</a>).</p>

<p>If a physician does not bring to the treatment of an
injury or of a disease the ordinary amount of skill possessed
by those in his profession, it is immaterial how high his
standing may be; if he has skill and does not apply it he
is guilty of negligence, and if he does not have it then he
is liable for the want of it. When a case of alleged malpractice
is before the court, the questions to be considered
are: Did the defendant possess the ordinary skill of persons
acting as medical men? If he did, was he chargeable in
not applying it in the treatment of the patient? Whether
<span class="xxpn" id="p063">|63|</span>
he possessed greater skill, or had been successful in the
treatment of other patients, is wholly immaterial. Where
the point in issue is whether skill was applied in a given
case, the possession of skill without proof that it was applied
will be no defence (<a id="fnanchor-140" href="#fn-140" class="fnanchor">140</a>).</p>

<p>The law punishes negligence no less than want of skill.
It is undoubtedly true that the physician is the best judge
of the degree of attention which any case requires. Nor is
it in the omission to make a given number of visits that
negligence resides, but whenever any important step in the
treatment of disease is neglected, or any important stage of
it overlooked, which might have been used for the benefit
of the patient, then it may be averred that the physician has
been guilty of negligence, however assiduous he may otherwise
have been at different periods of his treatment. Skill
and diligence may be considered, therefore, as indissolubly
associated, since skill judges of the measure of diligence
required and also furnishes the latter with the eyes of
observation and the hands of execution; while diligence on
her part gives cumulative power to skill, and leaves no link
wanting in the continuous train of treatment (<a id="fnanchor-141" href="#fn-141" class="fnanchor">141</a>). The
measure of skill which a physician is bound to exercise is
not affected by his refusal of the proffer of assistance from
other medical men (<a id="fnanchor-142" href="#fn-142" class="fnanchor">142</a>). The Court said that such a refusal
is no more than an implied declaration of ability to treat
the case properly. By assuming and continuing the charge
of the patient, the physician is under an obligation to exercise
a degree of skill which is neither increased or diminished
by such refusal.</p>

<p>In considering the skill and knowledge of a practitioner
regard must be had to the school to which he professes to
<span class="xxpn" id="p064">|64|</span>
belong; and where there is no particular system established
or favoured by law, and no system is prohibited, every
physician is expected to practise according to his professed
and avowed system. A botanic physician is to be
gauged according to the botanic system, and a homœopathic
physician by the homœopathic system: so if a
botanic doctor, or a homœopathist, is sued for malpractice
he may free himself from blame by showing that his practice
was according to the rules of the school which he professed
and was known to follow, and a departure from the received
canons of his system will be taken as a want of ordinary
skill. But the jury is not to judge by determining which
school in their own view is best (<a id="fnanchor-143" href="#fn-143" class="fnanchor">143</a>).</p>

<p>A sign or other proof that one actually practises physic
or surgery is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of his professional
character (<a id="fnanchor-144" href="#fn-144" class="fnanchor">144</a>). And when a physician’s skill is at issue he
may adduce evidence to prove the existence of such general
skill on his part, irrespective of the particular case as to
which the question arises; and he may show this by the
testimony of those in his profession who can speak from
personal knowledge of his practice (<a id="fnanchor-145" href="#fn-145" class="fnanchor">145</a>).</p>

<p>The possession of a medical diploma is <i>prima facie</i> of
ordinary skill. But of course it must be shown that the
college from which it emanated had authority to grant
degrees in medicine (<a id="fnanchor-146" href="#fn-146" class="fnanchor">146</a>).</p>

<p>If, in the absence of a medical man, a non-professional
person is called in to assist a person taken suddenly sick,
such amateur is not liable for special or slight negligence,
<span class="xxpn" id="p065">|65|</span>
that is for the lack of that diligence and skill belonging to a
professed physician; but he is liable for gross negligence
(the <i>culpa lata</i> of the Latinists), that is, the lack of the diligence
and skill belonging to ordinary unprofessional persons
of common sense; while, as we have seen, the physician is
liable for slight negligence (<i>culpa levis</i>), if he either undertakes
the case without the ordinary qualifications of a
physician under such circumstances, or manages it without
the ordinary skill of such a physician (<a id="fnanchor-147" href="#fn-147" class="fnanchor">147</a>).</p>

<p>If a physician treats a patient without being requested so
to do, he is held to a more strict account than in ordinary
cases. In one instance, a medical man administered
physic to a slave without the owner’s consent, and the court
held him responsible for all the evil consequences which
resulted (<a id="fnanchor-148" href="#fn-148" class="fnanchor">148</a>); and this rule is still more rigidly enforced when
the volunteer by his officiousness excludes a competent
practitioner who would have been otherwise obtainable. If
one who is not a regular medical practitioner professes to
deal with the life and health of others, he is bound to have
and employ competent skill (<a id="fnanchor-149" href="#fn-149" class="fnanchor">149</a>).</p>

<p>The mere fact that he renders his services gratuitously,
or out of charity, does not free the practitioner from all liability.
But, according to some authorities, the attendant
in such cases is held to a less strict accountability than
when his services are based upon an implied contract, and
is liable only for gross negligence (<a id="fnanchor-150" href="#fn-150" class="fnanchor">150</a>). Amos, in his “Science
of Law,” says, “The less the payment made in return for
diligence, the less the diligence that is expected; and if no
payment at all is made, as little diligence as possible is
<span class="xxpn" id="p066">|66|</span>
usually expected, though it may be that some is.” Wharton
cannot accept this doctrine from humane and other considerations (<a id="fnanchor-151" href="#fn-151" class="fnanchor">151</a>).
And Ordronaux says that it may be considered
as a received principle of law that, a physician, though
rendering his services gratuitously, as in hospitals or
among the out-door poor, is bound to exhibit the same
degree of ordinary skill and diligence in the treatment of a
patient as if he were acting under the incentive of a consideration
or prospective reward. If he undertakes to
execute the trust reposed in him, he is bound to do it well,
or else he may be compelled to respond in damages to the
party injured by his misfeasance. It is not the consideration
which constitutes the foundation of his responsibility,
but the fact that in voluntarily accepting the mandate,
<i>spondet peritiam artis</i>, in­dis­crim­i­nate­ly to all. He cannot
apportion medical skill or his diligence to meet the prospective
emoluments flowing out of any given case (<a id="fnanchor-152" href="#fn-152" class="fnanchor">152</a>).</p>

<p>In a criminal case, Denman, J., told the jury that it
made no difference whether a medical man was dealing
with a patient or acting as a volunteer, and dealing with a
friend or with his own wife (<a id="fnanchor-153" href="#fn-153" class="fnanchor">153</a>). But Cockburn, C.J., in a case
where a patient in a hospital sued two surgeons for injury
received from being scalded in a bath, in which he had
been placed by the nurses on the orders of the surgeons,
said, no doubt persons who went as patients into hospitals
were not to be treated with negligence; but, on the other
hand, medical gentlemen who gave their services gratuitously
were not to be made liable for negligence for which
they were not personally responsible. The jury gave a
verdict in favour of the doctors (<a id="fnanchor-154" href="#fn-154" class="fnanchor">154</a>).</p>

<p>If a sick man applies to one, not a physician, for
<span class="xxpn" id="p067">|67|</span>
gratuitous medical assistance, and this one either does not exert all
his skill, or administers improper medicine to the best of
his ability, he is not liable for damage (<a id="fnanchor-155" href="#fn-155" class="fnanchor">155</a>).</p>

<p>The amount of prudence which a man must exercise in
selecting a physician, and the means to be cured, is the
same that any prudent and reasonable man would do in
any other matter (<a id="fnanchor-156" href="#fn-156" class="fnanchor">156</a>).</p>

<p>It is the duty of a patient to co-operate with his medical
adviser, and to conform to the necessary prescriptions;
and if, under the pressure of pain, he does not, or, if by
refusing to adopt the remedies of the physician, he frustrates
the latter’s endeavours, or, if he aggravates the case
by his own misconduct, he cannot charge against the
physician the consequences due distinctively to himself;
for no one can take advantage of his own wrong. In such
a case, even if the physician’s treatment was objectionable,
he can only recover nominal damages; and if the injury
was due to the patient’s fractiousness and disregard of the
doctor’s orders (the latter being judicious), no action at all
will lie (<a id="fnanchor-157" href="#fn-157" class="fnanchor">157</a>).</p>

<p>In Ohio, it was held that, in an action for malpractice in
the treatment of a swollen ankle and diseased foot, the
Judge had not erred in saying to the jury, “If you find
that the defendant directed the plaintiff to observe absolute
rest as a part of the treatment to his foot, and that direction
was such as a surgeon or physician of ordinary skill
would adopt or sanction, and the patient negligently failed
to observe such direction, or purposely disobeyed the same,
and that such negligence or disobedience approximately
<span class="xxpn" id="p068">|68|</span>
contributed to the injury of which he complains, he cannot
recover in this action; although he may prove that the
defendant’s negligence and want of skill also contributed to
the injury. The injured party must not have contributed
at all.” The information given by a surgeon to his patient
concerning the nature of his malady is a circumstance that
should be considered in determining whether the patient,
in disobeying the instructions of the surgeon, was guilty of
negligence or not (<a id="fnanchor-158" href="#fn-158" class="fnanchor">158</a>).</p>

<p>The general doctrine of contributory negligence is this,
that although there may have been negligence on the
part of the plaintiff, yet, unless he might, by the exercise of
ordinary care, have avoided the consequence of the defendant’s
negligence, he is entitled to recover; if, by ordinary
care, he might have avoided it, then he is the author of his
own wrong (<a id="fnanchor-159" href="#fn-159" class="fnanchor">159</a>). The rule is laid down in another case as
follows: If it be impossible to separate the injury occasioned
by the plaintiff from that occasioned by the neglect
of the defendant, the plaintiff cannot recover; if, however,
they can be separated, for such injury as the plaintiff may
show thus preceded solely from the want of ordinary skill or
ordinary care of the defendant, he may recover (<a id="fnanchor-160" href="#fn-160" class="fnanchor">160</a>).</p>

<p>The patient must exercise ordinary care and prudence;
he is not bound to observe the utmost possible caution.
And the ordinary care required has been defined to be that
degree of care which persons of ordinary care and prudence
are accustomed to use and employ under similar circumstances (<a id="fnanchor-161" href="#fn-161" class="fnanchor">161</a>).
In fact the plaintiff must use his own
senses (<a id="fnanchor-162" href="#fn-162" class="fnanchor">162</a>). Still, if he is rash and negligent, and yet the
<span class="xxpn" id="p069">|69|</span>
physician has been so very neglectful that ordinary care on
the part of the patient would not have prevented the unfortunate
result, the plaintiff will be entitled to recover
damages (<a id="fnanchor-163" href="#fn-163" class="fnanchor">163</a>). So, where the doctor’s negligence is the
proximate cause of the injury, and that of the patient only
the remote cause (<a id="fnanchor-164" href="#fn-164" class="fnanchor">164</a>). And proximate does not mean the
first or nearest in order of time, but the first or nearest in
order of cause (<a id="fnanchor-165" href="#fn-165" class="fnanchor">165</a>).</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that a physician may be called
to prescribe for cases which originated in the carelessness
of the patient; and though such carelessness would remotely
contribute to the injury sued for, it would not relieve the
physician from liability for his distinct negligence and the
separate injury occasioned thereby. The patient may also,
while he is under treatment, injure himself by his own carelessness;
yet he may recover of the physician, if he carelessly
or unskilfully treats him afterwards, and thus does him a
distinct injury (<a id="fnanchor-166" href="#fn-166" class="fnanchor">166</a>). The burden of proving that the plaintiff’s
own negligence contributed to the injury rests upon
the defendant (<a id="fnanchor-167" href="#fn-167" class="fnanchor">167</a>). Evidence that the patient requested the
defendant to perform an operation, or do an act, which
caused the injury, does not tend to prove contributory
negligence, if the injury was not the natural result of such
act carefully performed (<a id="fnanchor-168" href="#fn-168" class="fnanchor">168</a>).</p>

<p>If the patient is insane, and so incapable of co-operating
with the physician, contributory negligence is not imputable.
And this inability the physician is bound to take
into account (<a id="fnanchor-169" href="#fn-169" class="fnanchor">169</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p070">|70|</span></p>

<p>If the physician has injured the patient by his negligence,
the refusal of the patient, or his custodian, to allow an experiment,
by another physician, to repair the injury is not
contributory negligence, unless he had reasonable assurance
of the success of the experiment (<a id="fnanchor-170" href="#fn-170" class="fnanchor">170</a>).</p>

<p>The practitioner is liable where a patient suffers from his
want of ordinary skill and diligence, even though the carelessness
of those nursing the patient may have aggravated
the case and rendered the ultimate condition of the patient
worse than it otherwise would have been. Although this
carelessness in nursing may be proved in mitigation of the
damages sought against the physician, it will not serve to
bar the right of action (<a id="fnanchor-171" href="#fn-171" class="fnanchor">171</a>). And where two surgeons, who
gave their services gratuitously to the sick in a hospital,
were sued by one Perionowsky, for maltreatment there by
causing him to be placed in a bath so hot that he was
scalded and injured, and it was proved that the bath,
though ordered by the defendants, was actually administered
by the nurses, and that the defendants were not
present when it was given, and that it was no part of their
duty personally to superintend such things. Cockburn,
C.J., in summing up, told the jury that the surgeons would
not be liable for the neglect of the nurses unless near
enough to be aware of it and to prevent it (<a id="fnanchor-172" href="#fn-172" class="fnanchor">172</a>). And, in
another case, the court held that if a jury were to find that
the parents of the patient (a boy) were in charge of and
nursed him during his sickness, and that they did not obey
the directions of the physician in regard to the treatment
and care of their son during such time, but disregarded the
same, and thereby contributed to the several injuries of
which he complains, he could not recover. If the injuries were
<span class="xxpn" id="p071">|71|</span>
the result of mutual and concurring neglect of the parties
no action to recover damages therefor will lie (<a id="fnanchor-173" href="#fn-173" class="fnanchor">173</a>).</p>

<p>The medical man has ofttimes to sail between Scylla and
Charybdis. While, on the one hand, he is bound to consult
the attainable literature in his profession, and to diligently
gather in, for every case he undertakes to treat, the
experience of his confreres—for in determining what is negligence,
the improvements that are constantly taking place
are always considered—at the same time he must not try
new modes or methods too readily, lest a Judge say of him,
as one said in a surgery case, “It appears from the evidence
of the surgeons that it was improper to disunite the
callus without consent. This is the usage and law of surgeons.
Then it was ignorance and unskilfulness, in that
very particular, to do contrary to the rule of the profession
what no surgeon ought to have done. For anything that
appears to the court, this was the first experiment made with
this new instrument; and, if it was, it was a rash action,
and he who acts rashly acts ignorantly; and although the
defendants (a surgeon and an apothecary), in general, may
be as skilful in their respective professions as any two gentlemen
in England, yet the court cannot help saying that, in
this particular case, they acted ignorantly and unskilfully,
contrary to the known rule and usage of surgeons;” (and
they had to pay the plaintiff £500 for the damage to his
leg) (<a id="fnanchor-174" href="#fn-174" class="fnanchor">174</a>). Success is the only thing that justifies an innovation
either in politics or physic.</p>

<p>When it is proved that the physician has omitted altogether
the established mode of treatment, and has adopted
one that has proved to be injurious, evidence of skill, or of
reputation for skill, is wholly immaterial, except to show
(what the law presumes) that he possesses the ordinary
<span class="xxpn" id="p072">|72|</span>
degree of skill of persons engaged in the same profession.
In such a case, it is of no consequence how much skill he
may have; he has demonstrated a want of it in the treatment
of the particular case.</p>

<p>The failure to use skill, if the surgeon has it, may be
negligence; but when the treatment adopted is not in
accordance with the established practice, but is positively
injurious, the case is not one of negligence, but of want of
skill. If the case is a new one, the patient must trust to
the skill and experience of the surgeon he calls. So must
he if the injury or disease is attended with injury to other
parts, or other diseases have developed themselves, for
which there is no established mode of treatment. But
when the case is one as to which a system of treatment
has been followed for a long time, there should be no
departure from it, unless the surgeon who does it is prepared
to take the risk of establishing by his success the
propriety and safety of his experiment. This rule
protects the community against reckless experiments, while
it admits the adoption of new remedies and modes of treatment
only when their benefits have been demonstrated,
or where, from the necessity of the case, the surgeon or
physician must be left to the exercise of his own skill and
experience (<a id="fnanchor-175" href="#fn-175" class="fnanchor">175</a>).</p>

<p>Physicians are not bound to comply with the demands
of the public; they may accept or refuse a call: but having
accepted, one must continue in attendance upon the case
until recovery, unless dismissed, or unless he has withdrawn
in a proper way. Even if his services are gratuitous, he
must continue them until reasonable time has been given to
procure other attendance.</p>

<p>A husband sued a medical man for neglecting to attend
<span class="xxpn" id="p073">|73|</span>
his wife, according to agreement, during childbirth, and
the jury gave him a verdict of $500; the court considered
that the physician had broken his contract and was liable
therefor, but reduced the damages to a nominal sum, as, in
an action on contract, the husband could not recover for the
personal injury and sufferings of the wife (<a id="fnanchor-176" href="#fn-176" class="fnanchor">176</a>).</p>

<p>If a physician at any time desires to withdraw from a
case, he must give such reasonable notice as will enable the
patient to obtain assistance elsewhere. He has a right to
withdraw at any time, especially with his patient’s consent,
but if he insists upon that assent as a shield from liability
for any negligence of which he may have been guilty,
or for any malpractice committed, the patient may show, if
he can, that the consent was obtained by rep­re­sen­ta­tions
that were false; and then the consent will be no protection
against liability for damage that had occurred before the
consent was given (<a id="fnanchor-177" href="#fn-177" class="fnanchor">177</a>).</p>

<p>While it is quite competent for a physician and his
patient to make any agreement they think fit, limiting the
attendance to a longer or shorter period, or to a single
visit; and while, if there is no such limitation, the physician
can discontinue his attendance at his own pleasure, after
giving reasonable notice of his intention to do so; yet, if he
is sent for at the time of an injury by one whose family
physician he has been for years, the effect of his responding
to the call will be an engagement to attend upon the case
so long as it requires attention, unless he gives notice to the
contrary, or is discharged by the patient; and he is bound
to use ordinary care and skill, not only in his attendance
but in determining when it may be safely and properly
discontinued (<a id="fnanchor-178" href="#fn-178" class="fnanchor">178</a>). Ordronaux says a physician cannot
<span class="xxpn" id="p074">|74|</span>
abandon a case without due notice. To do so would constitute
negligence of a grave character, and render him
answerable for all injury sustained by the patient in consequence
thereof. The contract is for the performance of
a service of indefinite duration, and usually without stipulation
for its continuance during any particular period. It
is plainly a fraud upon the employer to abandon or neglect
discharging the trust after having accepted it, for the
acceptance constitutes a promise, and a promise is a good
foundation upon which to rest a legal obligation. If the
physician retires from it, he can only do so by placing the
employer in as good circumstances as he found him, and
by giving due notice of his intention (<a id="fnanchor-179" href="#fn-179" class="fnanchor">179</a>).</p>

<p>A medical man is liable to a civil action for injury resulting
to a patient from his negligence or unskilful treatment,
although the patient neither employed nor was to pay him.
As Baron Parke said: “If an apothecary administers improper
medicines to his patient, or a surgeon unskilfully
treats him, and thereby injures his health, he will be liable
to the patient, even where the father or friend of the patient
may have been the contracting party with the apothecary
or surgeon; for, though no such contract had been made,
the apothecary, if he gave improper medicines, or the
surgeon, if he took him as a patient and unskilfully treated
him, would be liable to an action for a misfeasance” (<a id="fnanchor-180" href="#fn-180" class="fnanchor">180</a>).
And as Richards, C.B., said: “From the necessity of
the thing, the only person who can properly sustain an
action for damages for an injury done to the person of a
patient, is the patient himself, for damages could not be
given on that account to any other person, although the
surgeon may have been retained and employed by him to
undertake the case” (<a id="fnanchor-181" href="#fn-181" class="fnanchor">181</a>); and in this same case, which was an
<span class="xxpn" id="p075">|75|</span>
action brought by a husband and a wife for an injury done
to the wife, Garrow, B., said; “In the practice of surgery,
the public are exposed to great risks from the number of
ignorant persons professing a knowledge of the art, without
the least pretensions to the most necessary qualifications,
and they often inflict very serious injury on those who are
so unfortunate as to fall into their hands. In cases of the
most brutal inattention and neglect, the patients would be
precluded frequently from seeking damages by course of
law, if it were necessary to enable them to recover, that
there should have been a previous retainer, on their part,
of the person professing to be able to cure them. In all
cases of surgeons retained by any public establishments, it
would happen that the patient would be without redress,
for it could hardly be expected that the governors of an
infirmary should bring an action against the surgeon employed
by them to attend the child of poor parents, who
may have suffered from his negligence and inattention” (<a id="fnanchor-182" href="#fn-182" class="fnanchor">182</a>).</p>

<p>As in the case of an attorney, so with a physician, it is
not every mistake or misapprehension that will make him
liable to an action for negligence. There is scarcely a case
in which a physician is called in, in which he may not be
charged with <i>culpa levissima</i>, or the omission to ward off
every possible casualty; and if <i>culpa levissima</i> makes him
liable, then his liability becomes almost co-extensive with
his practice. He is only responsible for <i>culpa levis</i> (<a id="fnanchor-183" href="#fn-183" class="fnanchor">183</a>).</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the implied liability of a physician
or surgeon, retained to treat a case professionally,
extends no further, in the absence of a special agreement,
than that he will indemnify his patient against any injurious
consequences resulting from his want of the proper
degree of skill, care or diligence, in the execution of his
<span class="xxpn" id="p076">|76|</span>
employment; and in an action against the surgeon for
malpractice, the plaintiff, if he shows no injury resulting
from negligence or want of skill in the defendant, will not
be entitled to recover even nominal damages (<a id="fnanchor-184" href="#fn-184" class="fnanchor">184</a>).</p>

<p>The question whether the physician possessed adequate
skill, and exercised adequate care, is, in a case of malpractice,
for the jury to decide. Theoretically, and we may
add, literally, the jury have the unquestioned right to
decide every controverted fact, even if its decision may
involve the most abstrusively difficult and uncertain questions
in the regions of scientific enquiry. But it is for
the Judge to determine whether there is or not such
evidence as ought reasonably to satisfy the jury that the
fact sought to be proved is established. As Lord Cairns
once put it, “The Judge has to say whether any facts have
been established by evidence from which negligence <i>may be
reasonably inferred</i>, the jury have to say whether from
these facts, when submitted to them, <i>negligence ought to be
inferred</i>.” It is for the Judge to say whether the case
should or should not be submitted to the jury; and the rule
is imperative that it should not be, unless the evidence be
such that therefrom the negligence charged may be reasonably
inferred (<a id="fnanchor-185" href="#fn-185" class="fnanchor">185</a>).</p>

<p>Judges are generally desirous of impressing on juries
the necessity of construing everything in the most favourable
way for the defendant, when such actions are brought
against a surgeon. “It is notorious there are many cases
in which jurors are not the most dispassionate or most
competent persons to try the rights of parties, and an
action of this kind (<i>i. e.</i>, against a surgeon for malpractice)
comes within this class. In such actions the Judge should
<span class="xxpn" id="p077">|77|</span>
firmly assume the responsibility of determining himself
whether sufficient evidence has or has not been given to
compel him to leave the case to the jury” (<a id="fnanchor-186" href="#fn-186" class="fnanchor">186</a>).</p>

<p>Medical writers speak strongly against such actions. One
says, “In the majority of cases these actions are the direct
offspring of envy, hatred, malice and all un­char­i­table­ness,
and when, rocked in the cradle of calumny and nursed by
the hand of speculation, injury is often inflicted upon the
character of the physician, who is at the same time left
without any proper remedy at law. The effect, also, of such
suits upon the public mind is apt to be pernicious, for success
in obtaining damages often stimulates others into a
repetition of the experiment, and the physician consequently
practises his art in chains, being perpetually exposed to the
risk of a suit, which may ruin his reputation as well as his
fortune. It becomes lawyers, therefore, to consider, when
called upon to institute such suits, that little value can be
placed on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of a layman sitting as critic upon
the professional conduct of a physician. And that, aside
from such personal delinquencies as drunkenness, or gross
negligence, cruelty towards, or abandonment of his patient,
the field in which the physician discharges his professional
duties is practically <i>terra incognita</i> to the unlearned, and
one where no lay critic can follow him” (<a id="fnanchor-187" href="#fn-187" class="fnanchor">187</a>).</p>

<p>The same critic points out that the majority of suits for
malpractice have been brought against surgeons and not
against physicians. “Failure is rarely excused in a surgeon.
He is expected to be an adroit medical carpenter
who, with knife and saw and splint, can so re-construct the
fractured or disjointed members of the human body as to
leave no mark or line as evidence of their previous
<span class="xxpn" id="p078">|78|</span>
disruption. On the other hand, the physician, enshrined within
the penetralia of his mystic art, and mounted upon a Delphic
tripod, inaccessible to vulgar criticism, pronounces his
diagnosis and formulizes his prescriptions with unquestioned
judgment. His diagnosis may be faulty, his medicines
ill-selected, or ill-timed in their administration, and
still no blame be incurred by him for any evil consequences
that may ensue. For who will presume to say, in case of
the patient’s death, that he had not naturally reached that
last illness foreordained to all men, and of which the physician’s
unsuccessful treatment is only official testimony?
Who knows, in fact, when a man has reached his last illness
until he dies? *&#160;*&#160;* And, as a corollary to this,
strange as it may seem, one might, through unskilfulness,
sacrifice a human life with more impunity than he could
mutilate or deform a toe or a finger” (<a id="fnanchor-188" href="#fn-188" class="fnanchor">188</a>).</p>

<p>The question of the amount of damages for personal
injuries arising from malpractice is one resting a good deal
in the discretion of the jury, and must of necessity be more
or less uncertain. The party must recover all his damages,
present and prospective, in one action. If the damages
are so excessive as to strike all mankind, at first blush, as
beyond all measure unreasonable and outrageous, and such
as manifestly show the jury to have been actuated by
passion, partiality, corruption, or prejudice, the court will
grant a new trial. Sometimes, however, courts have granted
new trials for excessive damages where the excessiveness
has fallen short of this.</p>

<p>In considering what should be taken into account by a
jury estimating the amount of damages to be awarded, the
American courts have held, that the loss of time caused by
the injury is to be considered (<a id="fnanchor-189" href="#fn-189" class="fnanchor">189</a>). Also, the age and
<span class="xxpn" id="p079">|79|</span>
situation in life of the injured one, the expenses incurred,
the permanent effect upon the plaintiff’s capacity to pursue
his professional calling, or to support himself as beforetimes,
are essential factors (<a id="fnanchor-190" href="#fn-190" class="fnanchor">190</a>).</p>

<p>Bodily pain, too, is to be considered and compensated for;
and so much of mental suffering as may be indivisibly connected
with it; but mental anguish and agony cannot be
measured by money—the courts consider—and there is no
established rule authoritatively commanding such a futile
effort (<a id="fnanchor-191" href="#fn-191" class="fnanchor">191</a>). In fact, the courts say, that one should get
compensation for all the injuries that are the legal, direct,
and necessary results of the malpractice (<a id="fnanchor-192" href="#fn-192" class="fnanchor">192</a>).</p>

<p>The late case of <i>Phillips</i> v. <i>The South Western Railway
Company</i> fully enunciates what, in the estimation of the
English Judges, are to be considered in fixing the damages.
Cockburn, C.J., said, that the heads of damages were the
bodily injuries sustained, the pain undergone, the effect on
the health of the sufferer, according to its degree and its
probable duration as likely to be temporary or permanent,
the expenses incidental to attempts to effect a cure, and
the pecuniary loss sustained through inability to attend to
a profession or business (<a id="fnanchor-193" href="#fn-193" class="fnanchor">193</a>). In the Court of Appeal,
Bramwell, L.J., remarked, “You must give the plaintiff
a compensation for his pecuniary loss, you must give him
compensation for his pain and bodily suffering. Of course,
it is almost impossible to give an injured man what can be
strictly called compensation, but you must take a reasonable
view of the case, and must consider, under all the
circumstances, what is a fair amount to be awarded to
<span class="xxpn" id="p080">|80|</span>
him” (<a id="fnanchor-194" href="#fn-194" class="fnanchor">194</a>). Phillips, who was a physician of middle age and
robust health, making £5,000 a year, was so injured by a
railway company, that he was totally unable to attend to
his business; his life was a burden and a source of utmost
pain, and the probability was that he would never recover.
The jury gave him £16,000, and the court refused to consider
it excessive.</p>

<p>A physician, who has received personal injuries, may
recover damages for loss of business as a physician, although
he has not such a degree as would entitle him to maintain
an action for professional services (<a id="fnanchor-195" href="#fn-195" class="fnanchor">195</a>). The value of the
fees which he would have received without suit may be
estimated.</p>

<p>An action cannot be maintained against the representatives
of a deceased surgeon to recover damages arising from
the unskilful treatment of a patient. Such actions do not
survive (<a id="fnanchor-196" href="#fn-196" class="fnanchor">196</a>).</p>

<p>A medical practitioner who causes the death of a patient
by such malpractice or negligence as would have entitled
the patient (if death had not ensued) to maintain an action
and recover damages against him in respect of the injury
sustained thereby, is liable to an action for damages, not­with­stand­ing
the death of the patient, and although the
circumstances under which the death was caused amount
to felony. Such action may be brought for the benefit of
the wife, husband, parent and child of the deceased, and
the jury may give such damages as they may think proportioned
to the injury resulting from such death to the
parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such
<span class="xxpn" id="p081">|81|</span>
action is brought; but such injury must be a pecuniary
loss, and the jury may not give damages as a <i>solatium</i> (<a id="fnanchor-197" href="#fn-197" class="fnanchor">197</a>).
In some of the American cases the mental anguish caused
by the injury has been taken into account in estimating the
damages to be given (<a id="fnanchor-198" href="#fn-198" class="fnanchor">198</a>).</p>

<p>Not more than one action, however, will lie for and in
respect of the same subject-matter of complaint, and every
such action must be commenced within twelve months after
the death of the person injured.</p>

title="Chapter VI. Criminal Malpractice.">CHAPTER VI.
<span class="smallerblk">CRIMINAL MALPRACTICE.</span></h2></div>

<p>Whenever death ensues as the alleged consequence of
malpractice it becomes necessary to inquire into the conduct
of the physician, so as to determine how far his want of skill,
or negligence, has conspired to produce it. The offence
may, under certain circumstances indicating a wanton
and malicious disregard of human life, amount to murder.
Of course, a medical practitioner who should intentionally,
and with malice, cause the death of a patient, would be
held guilty of this crime; but in no case will an indictment
for murder lie, unless there be a felonious destruction of
life, with malice either express or implied. If a patient
die from want of competent skill or sufficient attention the
practitioner is guilty of manslaughter
(<a id="fnanchor-199" href="#fn-199" class="fnanchor">199</a>).
“If one that is
of the mystery of a physician take upon him the cure of a
man, and giveth him such physic so as he dieth thereof,
without any felonious intent and against his will, it is no
homicide.” So saith my Lord Coke. Blackstone says,
“This is neither murder nor manslaughter, but misadventure,
and he shall not be punished criminally.” On the
one hand, we must be careful and most anxious to prevent
people from tampering in physic so as to trifle with the life
of man; and on the other hand, we must take care not to
charge criminally a person who is of general skill because
he has been unfortunate in a particular case. It is God who
gives, man only administers, medicine; and the medicine
<span class="xxpn" id="p083">|83|</span>
that the most skilful may administer may not be productive
of the expected effect; but it would be a dreadful thing
if a man were to be called in question, criminally, whenever
he happened to miscarry in his practice. It would be most
fatal to the efficiency of the medical profession if no one
could administer medicine without a halter round his
neck (<a id="fnanchor-200" href="#fn-200" class="fnanchor">200</a>).</p>

<p>At one time it was held, that if one, not a regular physician
or surgeon, should administer a medicine or perform an
operation with a fatal effect, it would be manslaughter at the
least; but long since, by Sir Matthew Hale, (one of the
greatest Judges that ever adorned the English Bench), this
doctrine was questioned
(<a id="fnanchor-201" href="#fn-201" class="fnanchor">201</a>).
Now, however, both in England
and America, it is well settled that it makes no difference
whether the party be a regular practitioner or not; if
he, <i>bona fide</i> and honestly exercising his best skill to cure a
patient, performs an operation or administers a medicine
which causes the patient’s death he is not guilty of manslaughter.
“God forbid,” saith Lord Hale, “that any
mischance of this kind should make a person not licensed,
guilty of murder or manslaughter. This doctrine, that if
any one dies under the hand of an unlicensed physician, it is
felony, is apochryphal and fitted, I fear, to gratify and flatter
doctors and licentiates in physic; though it may have its
use, to make people cautious and wary how they take upon
themselves too much, in this dangerous employment.” Hullock,
B., remarked that it would be most dangerous for it to get
abroad that if an operation should fail the surgeon would
be liable to be prosecuted for manslaughter. And as to
making a difference between regular and irregular practitioners
the same learned Judge aptly put it, “in remote
parts of the country many persons would be left to die if
<span class="xxpn" id="p084">|84|</span>
irregular surgeons were not allowed to practise.” Or as
another Judge put it, we should have many of the poorer
sort of people die for want of help, lest their intended helpers
might miscarry (<a id="fnanchor-202" href="#fn-202" class="fnanchor">202</a>).</p>

<p>Lord Lyndhurst agrees with the rule, but makes an exception.
He says, “I agree that in these cases there is no
difference between a licensed physician or surgeon and a
person acting as a physician or surgeon without a license.
In either case if a party having a competent degree of skill
and knowledge makes an accidental mistake in the treatment
of a patient, through which mistake death ensues, he
is not thereby guilty of manslaughter; but if, where proper
medical assistance can be had, a person, totally ignorant
of the science of medicine, takes on himself to administer
a violent and dangerous remedy to one labouring under
disease, and death ensues in consequence of that dangerous
remedy having been so administered, then he is guilty of
manslaughter.” Webb, a publican, had given large doses
of Morrison’s pills to one ill of small-pox (<a id="fnanchor-203" href="#fn-203" class="fnanchor">203</a>).</p>

<p>“If any one, whether he be a regular or licensed medical
man or not, professes to deal with the life or health of
others, he is bound to have competent skill to perform the
task that he holds himself out to perform, and he is bound
to treat his patient with care, attention and assiduity;” and
if the patient dies for want of either, the practitioner is
guilty of manslaughter. “Every person who enters into
a learned profession undertakes to bring to the exercise of
it a reasonable degree of care and skill” (<a id="fnanchor-204" href="#fn-204" class="fnanchor">204</a>). And if a medical
man, though lawfully qualified to act as such, cause
<span class="xxpn" id="p085">|85|</span>
the death of a person by the grossly unskilful or grossly
incautious use of a dangerous instrument, he is guilty of
manslaughter. No one is justified in making use of an instrument,
in itself a dangerous one, unless he does so with
a proper degree of skill and caution (<a id="fnanchor-205" href="#fn-205" class="fnanchor">205</a>). There must be
competent knowledge and care in dealing with a dangerous
drug; if a man is ignorant of the nature of the drug he
uses, or is guilty of gross want of care in its use, it would
be criminal culpability (<a id="fnanchor-206" href="#fn-206" class="fnanchor">206</a>). In Iowa, it was held that one
assuming to act as a physician, who treats a patient in good
faith and to the best of his ability, is not criminally responsible
for the death of his patient, caused by the medicine he
administers (<a id="fnanchor-207" href="#fn-207" class="fnanchor">207</a>).</p>

<p>“To substantiate the charge of manslaughter, the prisoner
must have been guilty of criminal misconduct, arising
either from the grossest ignorance, or the most criminal
inattention; one or other of these is necessary to make him
guilty of that criminal negligence and misconduct which is
essential to make out a case of manslaughter.” Thus Lord
Ellenborough laid down the law in the case of a man midwife
who was on his trial for murder by malpractice (<a id="fnanchor-208" href="#fn-208" class="fnanchor">208</a>).
Long since in the <i>Mirror</i> (<a id="fnanchor-209" href="#fn-209" class="fnanchor">209</a>) it was said, “If physicians or
chirurgeons take upon them a cure, and have no knowledge
or skill therein, or if they have knowledge, if nevertheless
they neglect the cure, or minister that which is cold for
hot, or take little care thereof, or neglect due diligence
therein, and especially in burning and cutting off members,
which they are forbidden to do, but at the peril of their
patient; if their patients die or lose their members, in such
cases they are manslayers or mayhemdors.” Park, J.,
<span class="xxpn" id="p086">|86|</span>
charged the jury very similarly in one of St. John Long’s
celebrated cases. “If,” said his Lordship, “you think
there was gross ignorance or scandalous inattention in the
conduct of the prisoner, then you will find him guilty; if
you do not think so, then your verdict will be otherwise” (<a id="fnanchor-210" href="#fn-210" class="fnanchor">210</a>).</p>

<p>Wharton considers that the position assumed by Lord
Ellenborough depends upon the honesty and <i>bona fides</i>
of the practitioner; and that if he is pursuing a plan of
bold imposture the law would be otherwise (<a id="fnanchor-211" href="#fn-211" class="fnanchor">211</a>).</p>

<p>In Long’s case, Baron Garrow said, “I make no distinction
between the person who consults the most eminent
physician and the cases of those whose necessities or whose
folly may carry them into any other quarter. It matters
not whether the individual consulted be the President of the
College of Surgeons, or the humblest bone-setter of the
village; but, be it one or the other, he ought to bring into
the case ordinary skill and diligence. I am of opinion
that if a person who has ever so much or so little skill sets
my leg and does it as well as he can and does it badly, he
is excused; but, suppose the person comes drunk, and
gives me a tumbler full of laudanum, and sends me into
the other world, is it not manslaughter? And why is that?
Because I have a right to have reasonable care and caution.”
In a subsequent case against the same practitioner,
Bayley, B., said to the jury, “I have no hesitation in
saying for your guidance, that if a man be guilty of gross
neglect in attending to his patient after he has applied a
remedy, or of gross rashness in the application of it, and
death ensues in consequence, he will be liable to a conviction
for manslaughter.” “I consider rashness will be sufficient
to make it manslaughter. As, for instance, if I have
the toothache, and a person undertakes to cure it by
<span class="xxpn" id="p087">|87|</span>
administering laudanum, and says, ‘I have no notion how
much will be sufficient,’ but gives one a cupful, which
immediately kills; or if a person prescribing James’ powder
says, ‘I have no notion how much should be taken,’
and yet gives one a tablespoonful, which has the same
effect; such persons, acting with rashness, will, in my
opinion, be guilty of manslaughter. A prosecution is for
the public benefit, and the willingness of the patient cannot
take away the offence against the public” (<a id="fnanchor-212" href="#fn-212" class="fnanchor">212</a>).</p>

<p>The matter has been well put in a Missouri case. “If,”
said the Judge, “the party prescribing has so much
knowledge of the fatal tendency of the prescription that it
may reasonably be presumed that he administered the
medicine from an obstinate and wilful rashness, and not
from an honest intention and expectation of effecting a
cure, he is guilty of manslaughter at least, though he
might not have intended any bodily harm to the patient” (<a id="fnanchor-213" href="#fn-213" class="fnanchor">213</a>).
It is the presence of intention which determines the moral
complexion of an action, and whenever this intention (always
presumed to be good) is proved to be bad, then, and
then only, does a physician become criminally responsible
for his wrongdoings. Doubtless, a bad intention may be at
times inferred from the character of the misconduct; and
neglect, particularly when gross, may be classed among
those reasons which justify such an inference (<a id="fnanchor-214" href="#fn-214" class="fnanchor">214</a>).</p>

<p>What the law deems gross negligence has been thus
defined in a case where a “Herbalist” was on trial for
manslaughter, for the death of a patient through an overdose
of colchium seeds and brandy for a cold. “Gross
negligence might be of two kinds; in one sense, where a
man, for instance, went hunting, and neglected his patient,
<span class="xxpn" id="p088">|88|</span>
who died in consequence. Another sort of gross negligence
consisted in rashness, where a person was not sufficiently
skilled in dealing with dangerous medicines which should
be carefully used, of the properties of which he was ignorant,
or how to administer a proper dose. A person who,
with ignorant rashness, and without skill in his profession,
used such a dangerous medicine, acted with gross negligence.
It was not, however, every slip that a man might
make that rendered him liable to a criminal investigation.
It must be a substantial thing. If a man knew that he
was using medicines beyond his knowledge and was meddling
with things above his reach, that was culpable rashness.
Negligence might consist in using medicines in the
use of which care was required, and of the properties of
which the person using them was ignorant. A person who
so took a leap in the dark in the administration of medicines,
was guilty of gross negligence. If a man was
wounded and another man applied to his wound sulphuric
acid, or something which was of a dangerous nature, and
ought not to be applied, and which led to fatal results, then
the person who applied this remedy would be answerable,
and not the person who inflicted the wound, because a
new cause had supervened. But, if the person who
dressed the wound applied a proper remedy, then, if a
fatal result ensued, he who inflicted the wound remained
liable.” In these words Willes, J., charged the jury, and
they, after a long deliberation, brought in a verdict of “not
guilty” (<a id="fnanchor-215" href="#fn-215" class="fnanchor">215</a>). And in the very recent case of <i>State</i> v. <i>Hardister</i> (<a id="fnanchor-216" href="#fn-216" class="fnanchor">216</a>),
it was held that a physician is criminally liable
for his gross ignorance causing the death of his patient,
but not for a mere mistake of judgment.</p>

<p>However, in the celebrated case against the father and
founder of the botanic or steam system of medicine, whose
<span class="xxpn" id="p089">|89|</span>
favorite remedies were coffee, “well-my-gristle,” and “ram
cats,” it was held, that if a person assuming to be a physician,
through gross ignorance, but honestly and <i>bona fide</i>,
administers medicine which causes the death of the patient,
he is not guilty of manslaughter (<a id="fnanchor-217" href="#fn-217" class="fnanchor">217</a>). This was in the year
1809; and the doctrine laid down was followed in 1844 in
Missouri in an exactly similar case (<a id="fnanchor-218" href="#fn-218" class="fnanchor">218</a>). And quite recently
in Iowa, where one Shulz was tried for manslaughter
because his patient died under the Baunscheidt practice,
<i>i. e.</i>, pricking the body and rubbing in a certain kind of
oil, the Court on review said: “In 2 Bishop’s Criminal
Law, (4th Ed.) sec. 695, the law upon this subject is declared
as follows: ‘From the relationship of physician and
patient the death of the latter not unfrequently arises.
On this subject the doctrine seems to have been held that
whenever one undertakes to cure another of disease or to
perform on him a surgical operation, he renders himself
thereby liable to the criminal law, if he does not carry to
his duty some degree of skill, though what degree may not
be clear; consequently, if the patient dies through his ill-treatment,
he is indictable for manslaughter. On the other
hand, a more humane doctrine is laid down, that since it
is lawful and commendable for one to cure another, if he
undertakes this office in good faith and adopts the treatment
he deems best, he is not liable to be adjudged a felon,
though the treatment should be erroneous, and in the eyes
of those who assume to know all about this subject, which
in truth is understood by no mortal, grossly wrong, and
though he is a person called, by those who deem themselves
wise, grossly ignorant of medicine and surgery. The
former doctrine seems to be the English one, and so in
England a person, whether a licensed medical practitioner
or not, who undertakes to deal with the life or health of
<span class="xxpn" id="p090">|90|</span>
people, is bound to have competent skill or suffer criminally
for the defect. Now, if a man thinks he has competent
skill, and makes no mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion to his patients
concerning the amount or kind of medical education
actually received by himself, he seems in reason to stand
on exactly the foundation occupied by every person who
honestly undertakes medical practice after full advantages,
so far as concerns his state of mind, and it is the mind to
which we look in questions of legal guilt. Any person
undertaking a cure, but being grossly careless and thus
producing death, is for a different reason liable to a charge
of manslaughter, whether he is a licensed practitioner or
not.’ These cases seem to us to announce a correct rule.
The interests of society will be subserved by holding a
physician civilly liable in damages for the consequences of
his ignorance, without imposing upon him criminal liability
when he acts with good motives and honest intentions” (<a id="fnanchor-219" href="#fn-219" class="fnanchor">219</a>).</p>

<p>If the death of a man has been accelerated by the want
of due skill and competency, or by the carelessness, of his
physician, the latter cannot defend himself by proving that
his patient was afflicted with a mortal disease (<a id="fnanchor-220" href="#fn-220" class="fnanchor">220</a>). If a man
who has received a serious wound is placed under the charge
of a surgeon who, in probing the wound or otherwise operating
on the patient, immediately causes his death; then, if
the surgeon has acted negligently, or maliciously, he is
indictable for the homicide, and the original assailant only
for an attempt. But, if the surgeon using due skill and
care occasions death while he is endeavouring to heal
the wound, then he who inflicted the wound is chargeable
with the death; for he who does an unlawful act is responsible
for all the consequences that in the ordinary course
of events flow from it. It is an ordinary consequence of
a wound that a surgeon should be called in to attend to it,
<span class="xxpn" id="p091">|91|</span>
and it is a necessary incident of surgery that patients
should die under the knife. It is no defence, where a death
is not shewn to have been produced by the medical
attendant’s negligence, that the deceased might have recovered
if a higher degree of professional skill had been
employed (<a id="fnanchor-221" href="#fn-221" class="fnanchor">221</a>).</p>

<p>If a person is assailed by a fatal disease, and there is
no escape from it, save by a dangerous surgical operation,
then, if he gives his free and intelligent consent to the
operation, and it is skilfully performed, the surgeon cannot
be blamed even though the patient perish under the knife.
The German Jurists go still further and say, suppose a
dangerous operation is required as the last hope of resuscitating
an unconscious person; if the operation is performed
with the skill usual to surgeons under such circumstances,
and death ensue, the surgeon is blameless (<a id="fnanchor-222" href="#fn-222" class="fnanchor">222</a>). If a woman
is in such a state of labor that her life can only be preserved
by the sacrifice of that of the child, then it is not
only the right but the duty of the attendant to save the
mother at the expense of the babe. Wharton says that this
position is indisputable (<a id="fnanchor-223" href="#fn-223" class="fnanchor">223</a>).</p>

<p>From the leading cases the following propositions may
be extracted, say Wharton and Stillè, sec. 1063.</p>

<p>1. If the defendant acted honestly and used his best skill
to cure, and it does not appear that he thrust himself in
the place of a competent person, it makes no difference
whether he was at the time a regular physician or surgeon,
or not.</p>

<p>2. To constitute guilt, gross ignorance or negligence
must be proved.
<span class="xxpn" id="p092">|92|</span></p>

<p>3. A defendant who, with competent knowledge, makes
a mistake in a remedy is not answerable, but it is otherwise
when a violent remedy, shewn to have occasioned
death, is administered by a person grossly ignorant but
with average capacity, in which case malice is presumed
in the same way that it is presumed when a man <i>compos
mentis</i> lets loose a mad bull into a thoroughfare, or casts
down a log of wood on a crowd.</p>

<p>4. Where competent medical aid can be had, the application
of violent remedies by an ignorant person, though
with the best motives, involves him in criminal responsibility.</p>

<p>5. Express malice, or an intent to commit a personal or
social wrong, makes the practitioner criminally responsible
in all cases of mischief.</p>

<p>These well known writers say, that according to Caspar
and Böcker, in the treatment of internal diseases, the physician
can never be held guilty of criminal carelessness for
failing to use any particular remedy, since there is never
any remedy upon which all authorities are agreed, and
since it is always possible the patient may recover without
the use of such remedy (<a id="fnanchor-224" href="#fn-224" class="fnanchor">224</a>).</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="p093"
title="Chapter VII. Professional Evidence.">CHAPTER VII.
<span class="smallerblk">PROFESSIONAL EVIDENCE.</span></h2></div>

<p>It was decided nearly one hundred years ago, in the
Duchess of Kingston’s case, that a medical man has no
privilege to avoid giving in evi­dence any statement made
to him by a patient, but that he is bound to disclose, when
called upon to do so in a court of justice, every communication,
however private and con­fi­dential, which has been
made to him by a patient while attending him in a professional
capacity (<a id="fnanchor-225" href="#fn-225" class="fnanchor">225</a>). This has often been deemed a grievance
by medical men, and considered a compulsory breach of
pro­fes­sion­al ethics; for the relations between patient and
physician, being necessarily of a conf­i­den­tial character,
com­mun­i­ca­tions made to a physician are looked upon, by
the pro­fes­sion, as confes­sions which should be kept religiously
locked in the brain of the physician. Lord Mansfield
said, “If a medical man was voluntarily to reveal those
secrets, to be sure he would be guilty of a breach of honour
and of great indiscretion, but to give that information
which by the law of the land he is bound to do will never
be imputed to him as any indiscretion whatever” (<a id="fnanchor-226" href="#fn-226" class="fnanchor">226</a>).</p>

<p>A French writer says, the tribunals neither ought, nor
have they the power, to exact from a physician the revelation
of a secret confided to him because of his office; at all
events, he may and ought to refuse to tell. Religion,
<span class="xxpn" id="p094">|94|</span>
probity, nay, the rights of society, make this the law.
Still more are we bound to secrecy when not compelled to
disclose. Upon this point casuists and jurisconsults are of
one opinion (<a id="fnanchor-227" href="#fn-227" class="fnanchor">227</a>).</p>

<p>These communications between physician and patient,
which may relate to the history of a transaction in which
a wound has been received, or a particular disease communicated,
whenever essential to the treatment of the patient’s
case, are in some States of the American Union considered
privileged communications, which the physician is
either expressly forbidden, or not obliged, to reveal. This
is the law in Arkansas, California, Indiana, Michigan, Iowa,
Missouri, Minnesota, Montana, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin.
In Wisconsin he is not compelled, and in the other
States named he is not allowed to make the disclosure;
but in Minnesota the prohibition extends only to civil cases;
and in Iowa, Indiana and Minnesota, the seal can be
removed by the patient himself. In these States the confession,
in order to be protected against disclosure, must
relate exclusively to such matters as are indispensable to
the professional treatment of the patient. Communications
made outside of this sphere acquire no immunity from
having been entrusted to physicians, for at common law
such are not deemed privileged, and wherever so recognized
they are the creatures of statutory enactment (<a id="fnanchor-228" href="#fn-228" class="fnanchor">228</a>).</p>

<p>As stated, in some of the above-mentioned States, the
party interested may waive the privilege, in which case the
communication may be disclosed (<a id="fnanchor-229" href="#fn-229" class="fnanchor">229</a>). But in New York it
is expressly enacted that “no person duly authorized to
practise physic, or surgery, shall be allowed to disclose any
information which he may have acquired in attending any
<span class="xxpn" id="p095">|95|</span>
patient in a professional character, and which information
was necessary to enable him to prescribe for such patient
as a physician, or to do any act for him as a surgeon” (<a id="fnanchor-230" href="#fn-230" class="fnanchor">230</a>).</p>

<p>Yet, even there, the statute will not be construed so as to
shield a person charged with a crime, instead of being a
protection to the victim, the patient (<a id="fnanchor-231" href="#fn-231" class="fnanchor">231</a>).</p>

<p>The seal upon the physicians lips is not taken away by
the patient’s death (<a id="fnanchor-232" href="#fn-232" class="fnanchor">232</a>).</p>

<p>Necessarily all communications to be privileged must
be of a lawful character, and not against morality or
public policy; hence a consultation as to the means of
procuring an abortion on another is not privileged; nor,
by parity of reason, would any similar conference which
was held for the purpose of devising a crime or evading its
consequences (<a id="fnanchor-233" href="#fn-233" class="fnanchor">233</a>).</p>

<p>It must appear not only that the information was acquired
during professional attendance, but was such as was necessary
to enable the physician to prescribe. It is for the
party objecting to shew that the information sought to be
obtained is within the statutory exclusion. “It will not
do to extend the rule of exclusion so far as to embarrass
the administration of justice. It is not even all information
which comes within the letter of the statute which is
to be excluded. The exclusion is aimed at confidential
communications of a patient to his physician, and also
such information as a physician may acquire of secret
ailments by an examination of the person of his patient.
The policy of the statute is to enable a patient, without
danger of exposure, to disclose to his physician all
<span class="xxpn" id="p096">|96|</span>
information necessary for his treatment. Its purpose is to invite
confidence and to prevent a breach thereof. Suppose a
patient has a fever, or a fractured leg or skull, or is a
raving maniac, and these ailments are obvious to all about
him, may not the physician who is called to attend him
testify to these matters?” “Before information sought to be
obtained from physicians, witnesses, can be excluded the
court must know somewhat of the circumstances under
which it was acquired, and must be able to see that it is
within both the language and the policy of the law” (<a id="fnanchor-234" href="#fn-234" class="fnanchor">234</a>).</p>

<p>A report of the medical officer of an insurance company
on the health of a party proposing to insure his life is not
privileged from production; nor is the report of a surgeon
of a railway company, as to the injuries sustained by a
passenger in an accident, unless such a report has been
obtained with a view to impending litigation (<a id="fnanchor-235" href="#fn-235" class="fnanchor">235</a>).</p>

<p>Representations made by a sick person of the nature
and effects of the malady under which he is suffering are
receivable as original evidence, whether made to a physician
or to any other; though, if made to a physician, they are
entitled to greater weight than if made to a man incapable
of forming a correct judgment respecting the accuracy of
the statements, from unacquaintance with the symptoms of
diseases (<a id="fnanchor-236" href="#fn-236" class="fnanchor">236</a>). When the bodily or mental feelings of a party
are to be proved, his exclamations or expressions indicating
present pain or malady are competent evidence (<a id="fnanchor-237" href="#fn-237" class="fnanchor">237</a>); and
<span class="xxpn" id="p097">|97|</span>
the complaints and statements of the injured party, if
made at the very time of the occurrence, are admissible as
<i>res gestæ</i>, not only as to the bodily suffering, but as to the
circumstances of the occurrence; and the time in question
is not the time of injury, but the time when it is material
to prove a condition of bodily or mental suffering, and that
may be material for weeks, and perhaps months, after an
injury has been inflicted. The statements are admissible
even though made after the commencement of an action,
though this may be a circumstance to detract from the
weight of the evidence of a physician, so far as it was
founded on the statements (<a id="fnanchor-238" href="#fn-238" class="fnanchor">238</a>). But statements or declarations
of a sick or injured person, referring to his state and
condition at a time past, and not furnishing evidence of a
present existing malady, are to be carefully excluded,
whether made to an expert or a non-expert (<a id="fnanchor-239" href="#fn-239" class="fnanchor">239</a>), and statements
in writing by patients to a medical man, describing
the symptoms of the illness upon which the physician has
advised the patient, are also inadmissible in evidence (<a id="fnanchor-240" href="#fn-240" class="fnanchor">240</a>).
It has been said in Illinois, that as a physician must
necessarily, in forming his opinion, be, to some extent,
guided by what the sick person may have told him in detailing
his pains and sufferings, not only the opinion of the
expert, founded in part upon such data, is receivable in evidence,
but that he may state what the patient said in describing
his bodily condition, if said under circumstances
which free it from all suspicions of being spoken with reference
to future litigation and give it the character of <i>res
gestae</i> (<a id="fnanchor-241" href="#fn-241" class="fnanchor">241</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p098">|98|</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, in Massachusetts, in an action for
personal injuries, a surgeon who had attended plaintiff was
held competent to testify as to plaintiff’s condition from
what he saw, but not from anything the patient told him (<a id="fnanchor-242" href="#fn-242" class="fnanchor">242</a>).
A physician testified that the plaintiff stated she had
received a blow in the stomach. The Court said that it
would clearly have been competent for the physician, after
having testified to the plaintiff’s condition and to the complaints
and symptoms of pain and sufferings stated by her,
to have given his opinion that they were such as might have
been expected to follow the infliction of a severe blow. But
it was not competent for the physician to testify to her
statement that she had received a blow in her stomach (<a id="fnanchor-243" href="#fn-243" class="fnanchor">243</a>).
And in Tennessee, the statement made by a man when his
wounds were being examined, as to who made them, or as
to the instrument with which they were inflicted, was
deemed inadmissible (<a id="fnanchor-244" href="#fn-244" class="fnanchor">244</a>).</p>

<p>Memoranda, although not legal instruments in the proper
sense of the term, have been considered as an inferior class
of records, and as such entitled to some standing in courts.
Such minutes of past facts may be used by experts while
under examination, but only to refresh their memory, and
not to take its place. For this purpose they may use
written entries in note books, or even copies of them, provided
always they can swear to the truth of the facts as
there stated. Yet, if they can not from recollection speak
to the fact any farther than as finding it stated in a written
entry, their testimony will amount to nothing. It is not
necessary that the writing should have been made by the
expert himself, nor even that it should be an original
<span class="xxpn" id="p099">|99|</span>
writing, provided, after inspecting it, he can testify to the facts
from his own recollection (<a id="fnanchor-245" href="#fn-245" class="fnanchor">245</a>).</p>

<p>The English and American authorities agree that medical,
or other scientific books, are not competent evidence in
courts of law; they cannot be put in evidence, although
the medical witnesses state that such books are works of
authority in medicine. Tindal, C.J., thought that witnesses
might be asked whether in the course of their reading
they had found such-and-such a rule laid down; they might
be asked how far their opinion was founded on books, and
might refer to such books; they might be asked their
judgment on the point, and the grounds of it, which may
be in some degree founded on these books, as a part of
their general knowledge, but the book itself could not be read.
And as late as 1875, Mr. Justice Brett refused to allow
Taylor’s Medical Jurisprudence to be read to the jury, saying:
“That is no evidence in a court of justice. It is a
mere statement by a medical man of hearsay facts of cases
at which he was, in all probability, not present. I cannot
allow it to be read.” And the refusal seems to be the rule
in England. And Redfield, C.J., says, that when objected
to, these books have not generally been allowed to be read
in the United States, either to the Court or jury. And a
very recent writer says, “The result of the cases on
this subject shews clearly that the very decided weight of
authority is against the admissibility in evidence of standard
medical treatises.” Such is the rule in England,
Ontario, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
North Carolina, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, supported
by <i>dicta</i> in California and New Hampshire, and opposed by
decisions in Alabama and Iowa (<a id="fnanchor-246" href="#fn-246" class="fnanchor">246</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p100">|100|</span></p>

<p>In Iowa and Wisconsin such books have been allowed to
be read, the Court in one case remarking, “The opinion
of an author, as contained in his works, we regard as better
evidence than the mere statement of those opinions by
a witness, who testifies as to his recollection of them from
former reading. Is not the latter secondary to the former?
On the whole, we think it the safest rule to admit standard
medical books as evidence of their opinions upon questions
of medical skill or practice involved in the treatment.”
In Wisconsin, however, the court seems now to have overruled
its earlier decisions, and to have sided with the
majority (<a id="fnanchor-247" href="#fn-247" class="fnanchor">247</a>).</p>

<p>In Illinois, a witness may, to test his knowledge, be
cross-examined as to his reading of particular authors
upon the subject, and as to whether reputable writers do
not entertain certain views upon the subject. Paragraphs
from standard authors, treating of the disease in question,
may be read to the witness, and he may be asked if he
agrees therewith, as one of the means of testing his knowledge;
but care should be taken by the court to confine such
cross-examination within reasonable limits, and to see that
the quotations read are fairly selected so as to present the
author’s views. Mr. Rogers questions the wisdom of this
decision (<a id="fnanchor-248" href="#fn-248" class="fnanchor">248</a>). The witness, however, cannot read from a
scientific work in his examination in chief, though he be an
expert and agree with the views expressed by the author (<a id="fnanchor-249" href="#fn-249" class="fnanchor">249</a>).
Nor can a passage from a book be got before a jury as evidence
in an indirect manner, when it cannot be read to
them. So it was decided where a medical man was asked
if he was acquainted with a certain book; he replied, that
he had heard of it, but had not read it. He was then asked
<span class="xxpn" id="p101">|101|</span>
whether it was considered good authority, and he said it
was. He was then asked to read a certain paragraph; this
he did, and was re-called. Counsel then read from the
book the same paragraph and asked if such a case as that
stated was reported. Held to be error (<a id="fnanchor-250" href="#fn-250" class="fnanchor">250</a>). And in Ontario
it has been held improper to ask medical witnesses, on
cross-examination, what books they consider best upon the
subject in question, and then to read such books to the jury;
but they may be asked whether such books have influenced
their opinion (<a id="fnanchor-251" href="#fn-251" class="fnanchor">251</a>).</p>

<p>Although, as a rule, scientific books cannot be read to a
jury as evidence, they may be read to discredit the testimony
of experts, who claim to be familiar with them and refer
to them as authority. Where one borrows credit for his
accuracy, by referring to books treating of the subject, and
by implying that he echoes the standard authorities, the
book may be resorted to, to disprove the statement of the
witness, and to enable the jury to see that the book does
not contain what he says it does, and thus to disparage the
witness, and hinder the jury from being imposed upon by
a false light (<a id="fnanchor-252" href="#fn-252" class="fnanchor">252</a>). It has been held again and again that
scientific books cannot be read by counsel to the jury as a
part of their argument. Shaw, C.J., of Massachusetts,
says, “Facts or opinions cannot be laid before the jury,
except by the testimony under oath of persons skilled in
such matters.” Again, “where books are thus offered (<i>i. e.</i>,
to be read in argument), they are, in effect, used as evidence,
and the substantial objection is, that they are statements
wanting the sanction of an oath; and the statement thus
proposed is made by one not present, and not liable to cross-examination.
If the same author were cross-examined, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p102">|102|</span>
called to state the grounds of his opinions, he might,
himself, alter or modify it, and it would be tested by a
comparison with the opinions of others. Medical authors,
like writers in other departments of science, have their
various and conflicting theories, and often defend and
sustain them with ingenuity. But as the whole range
of medical literature is not open to persons of common
experience, a passage may be found in one book favorable
to a particular opinion, when, perhaps, the same opinion
may have been vigorously contested, and, perhaps, triumphantly
overthrown, by other medical authors, but authors
whose works would not be likely to be known to counsel or
client, or to Court or jury. Besides, medical science has its
own nomenclature, its technical terms and words of art,
and also common words used in a peculiar manner, distinct
from the received meaning in the general use of the
language. From these and other causes, persons not versed
in medical literature, though having a good knowledge of
the general use of the English language, would be in danger,
without an interpreter, of misapprehending the true meaning
of the author. Whereas a medical witness could not
only give the fact of his opinion, and the grounds on which
it is formed, with the sanction of his oath, but would also
state and explain it in language intelligible to men of common
experience. If it be said that no books should be
read, except works of good and established authority, the
difficulty at once arises as to the question, what constitutes
“good authority?” (<a id="fnanchor-253" href="#fn-253" class="fnanchor">253</a>).</p>

<p>In an English case, counsel, in addressing the jury,
attempted to quote from a work on surgery; Alderson, B.,
would not allow him, saying, “You surely cannot contend
that you may give the book in evidence, and if not, what
right have you to quote from it in your address, and do
that indirectly which you would not be permitted to do in
<span class="xxpn" id="p103">|103|</span>
the ordinary course?” In Massachusetts, North Carolina,
Michigan, California and New York, similar decisions have
been given (<a id="fnanchor-254" href="#fn-254" class="fnanchor">254</a>); and in giving the dissenting opinion in <i>State
and Hoyt</i> (<a id="fnanchor-255" href="#fn-255" class="fnanchor">255</a>), Loomis, J., said, “Books may be crazy as well
as men, and all sorts of theories relative to responsibility for
crime are advocated in books. Courts do not take judicial
notice of standard medical or scientific works, and the standard
works of to-day may not long continue such, owing to
new discoveries and advancing knowledge.” In this case
the question was as to reading medical books on insanity
on trials where the question of insanity arose; the book
was Ray’s “Medical Jurisprudence of Insanity.” In a
still later case (<a id="fnanchor-256" href="#fn-256" class="fnanchor">256</a>), it was held to have been error for the
attorney, on the argument, to read to the jury extracts from
Browne’s “Medical Jurisprudence of Insanity.” The Court
said, that it is peculiarly important that a defendant charged
with a crime should be confronted by the expert witnesses
against him, and that they should be cross-examined in his
presence. But when the opinions of a writer are permitted
to go to the jury, the writer is not sworn or cross-examined.
If held admissible the question (of insanity) may be tried,
not by the testimony, but upon excerpts from works presenting
partial views of variant and perhaps contradictory
theories (<a id="fnanchor-257" href="#fn-257" class="fnanchor">257</a>).</p>

<p>In Connecticut, however, in a murder case the Court (Loomis, J., and
Park, C.J., out of the five Judges dissenting,) held, that standard
medical works on insanity might be read to the jury by the counsel for
the accused, when
<span class="xxpn" id="p104">|104|</span>
discussing the question of his insanity. It was said that
“in this jurisdiction (that of Connecticut) for a long series
of years counsel have been permitted to read to the jury,
as a part of their argument upon this part of their case,
extracts from such treatises as by the testimony of experts
have been accepted by the profession as authority upon that
subject, such treatises as have helped to form the opinion
expressed by the expert. The practice by repetition has
hardened into a rule” (<a id="fnanchor-258" href="#fn-258" class="fnanchor">258</a>). In Indiana, it was held that if the
extracts were merely argumentative and contained no
opinions that could be regarded as properly matters of
evidence, they might be admitted, subject to the instructions
of the Court as to the law of the case and under the warning
that they were not evidence. In Texas and in Delaware,
similar decisions have been given (<a id="fnanchor-259" href="#fn-259" class="fnanchor">259</a>). And in Ohio, where,
at the trial of a cause, counsel was forbidden to read to the
jury Youatt’s work on Veterinary Surgery, the Court, on
appeal, said, “It is not to be denied, but that a pertinent
quotation or extract from a work on science or art, as well
as from a classical, historical, or other publication, may, by
way of argument or illustration, be not only admissible, but
sometimes highly proper, and it would seem to make no
difference whether it was repeated by counsel from recollection
or read from a book. It would be an abuse of this
privilege, however, to make it the pretence of getting
improper matter before the jury as evidence in the cause.”
As it did not appear that the proposed quotation was relevant
or came within the appropriate and legitimate scope
of the argument, or that the party was injured by its
exclusion, the Court would not reverse on this ground (<a id="fnanchor-260" href="#fn-260" class="fnanchor">260</a>).
Where the reading is allowed, it seems to be considered “a
valuable privilege, yet so susceptible of abuse, that the
<span class="xxpn" id="p105">|105|</span>
extent and manner of its exercise must be entrusted in
a great measure to the sound discretion of the Court;”—“not
a practice ever sanctioned directly or indirectly by the Court,
nor one which has generally been considered by the Judges
as of binding force in law, but rather as subject to the discretion
which, it is true, has been usually exercised in favor
of the accused in capital trials” (<a id="fnanchor-261" href="#fn-261" class="fnanchor">261</a>).</p>

<p>Where the exclusion rule obtains, counsel in addressing
the jury has no right to quote the opinions of medical men
as given in their works; if they do, it is the duty of the
Court to instruct the jury that such books are not in evidence
but theories simply of medical men (<a id="fnanchor-262" href="#fn-262" class="fnanchor">262</a>). But there is no
question that, under all circumstances, books of science may
be read in argument to the Court.</p>

<p>Medical men are often called to give evidence as to dying
declarations where there is a charge of homicide, and where
the cause of the death of the declarant is the subject of the
declaration. They should remember that the declaration
will not be admissible unless the deceased was conscious of
approaching death and made it under a sense of his impending
doom; any hope of recovery, however slight, renders the
declaration inadmissible; and the question turns rather
upon the expectation of death at the time of making the
declaration than upon the interval between it and the
death (<a id="fnanchor-263" href="#fn-263" class="fnanchor">263</a>).</p>

<p>An entry made by a medical man, in the course of his profession,
is admissible in evidence after his death, if it be
against his interest; and such an entry will be received
as evidence of collateral and independent matter, etc. When
<span class="xxpn" id="p106">|106|</span>
the question was as to the age of a child, the book of the
accoucheur who attended the mother was produced; it contained
an entry as follows, “W. Fowden, Jun.’s, wife; <i>Filius
circa hor. 3 post merid. nat.</i> etc. W. Fowden, 1768, April 22.
<i>Filius natus</i> wife, £1 6s. 1d.; Pd. 25 Oct. 1768.” The word
“Paid” was against the pecuniary interest of the accoucheur,
so the entry was admitted to prove the date of the
birth (<a id="fnanchor-264" href="#fn-264" class="fnanchor">264</a>).</p>

<p>In England the rule is thus laid down as to excluding
experts from the room during the examination of witnesses;
“medical or other professional witnesses, who are
summoned to give scientific opinions upon the circumstances
of the case as established by other testimony, will be permitted
to remain in court until this particular class of
evidence commences, but then, like ordinary witnesses, they
will have to withdraw, and to come in one by one, so as to
undergo a separate examination.” A similar rule prevails
in Scotland and in the United States (<a id="fnanchor-265" href="#fn-265" class="fnanchor">265</a>).</p>

<p>It would seem that the court has power to limit the
number of experts in any case (<a id="fnanchor-266" href="#fn-266" class="fnanchor">266</a>).</p>

<p>Taylor, in his well-known work on “Medical Jurisprudence,”
lays down many valuable suggestions for the guidance
of medical witnesses; among other things, he says,
“In reference to <i>facts</i>, a medical witness must bear in
mind that he should not allow his testimony to be influenced
by the consequences that may follow from his statement
of them, or there probable effect on any case which is
under trial. In reference to <i>opinions</i>, their possible influence
on the fate of a prisoner should inspire caution in
<span class="xxpn" id="p107">|107|</span>
forming them; but, when once formed, they should be
honestly and candidly stated, without reference to consequences.”
“The questions put on either side should receive
direct answers from the medical witness, and his manner
should not be perceptibly different whether he is replying
to a question put by the counsel for the prosecution, or for
the defence.” “The replies should be concise, distinct and
audible, and except where explanation may be necessary,
they should be confined strictly to the terms of the question.”
“Answers to questions should be neither ambiguous, undecided,
nor evasive.” “The replies should be made in simple
language, free from technicality.” “A medical witness
may, without any imputation upon his <i>bona fides</i>, explain
medical points to counsel, and correct him on medical
subjects, when wrong in his views or statements, but he
should avoid even the appearance of prompting counsel in
the conduct of the case.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="p108"

CHAPTER VIII.
<span class="smallerblk">MEDICAL EXPERTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Whenever the subject matter of a legal enquiry is such
that, from its partaking of the nature of a science, art or
trade, inexperienced persons are unlikely to prove capable
of forming a correct judgment upon it without assistance,
then the opinions of witnesses possessing peculiar skill and
knowledge in the matters in question are admissible in courts
of justice. And it is only when the matter inquired of lies
within the range of the peculiar skill and experience of the
witnesses, and is one of which the ordinary knowledge and
experience of mankind does not enable them to see what
inference should be drawn from the facts, that the skilled
witnesses may supply opinions as their guide (<a id="fnanchor-267" href="#fn-267" class="fnanchor">267</a>). The rule
admitting the opinions of experts in such cases is founded
on necessity, for juries are not selected with any view to
their knowledge of a particular science, art or trade, requiring
a course of previous study, experience or preparation (<a id="fnanchor-268" href="#fn-268" class="fnanchor">268</a>).</p>

<p>The rule of law on which the giving in evidence the
opinion of witnesses, who know nothing of the actual facts
of the case, is founded, is not peculiar to medical testimony,
but is as a general rule applicable to all cases where the
question is one depending on skill and science in any particular
department. .&#160;.&#160;. In general it is the opinion of the
jury which is to govern, and this is to be formed upon the
<span class="xxpn" id="p109">|109|</span>
proof of the facts laid before them. But some questions lie
beyond the scope of the observation and experience of men
in general, yet are quite within the observation and experience
of those whose peculiar pursuits and profession have
brought that class of facts frequently and ha­bit­ually under
their con­sid­er­a­tion. When, therefore, a question arises in
a court of justice upon any such subject, and certain facts
are proved by other witnesses, one skilled in such subject
may be asked his opinion as to the character of such facts;
or he may be asked his opinions on certain facts
observed by himself. This is true with regard to any
question of science, because persons conversant with such
science have peculiar means, from a larger and more exact
observation and long experience in such department of
science, of drawing correct inferences from certain facts
observed by themselves or testified to by other witnesses.
The opinion of such witnesses is designed to aid the judgment
of the jury in regard to the influence and effects of
certain facts which lie out of the observation and experience
of persons in general (<a id="fnanchor-269" href="#fn-269" class="fnanchor">269</a>). These witnesses are called
“experts.” This term seems to imply both superior knowledge
and practical experience in the art or profession. But
generally nothing more is required to entitle one to give
testimony as an expert, than that he has been educated in
the particular art or profession; for persons are presumed
to understand questions pertaining to their own profession
or business (<a id="fnanchor-270" href="#fn-270" class="fnanchor">270</a>).</p>

<p>The practice of admitting the evidence of experts is an
old one: in the Roman Law they are frequently alluded
to, and in the earliest Common Law reports they are
spoken of as of established usage. Says Saunders, J.,
“and first I grant that if matters arise in our law which
<span class="xxpn" id="p110">|110|</span>
concern other sciences or faculties we commonly apply for
the aid of that science or faculty which it concerns. In a
case of mayhem the defendant prayed the court that the
wound might be examined, on which a writ was issued to
the sheriff to cause to come “<i>medicos chirurgos de
melioribus London. ad informandum Dominum regem et
curiam de his quæ eis exparte Domini Regis injungerentur</i> (<a id="fnanchor-271" href="#fn-271" class="fnanchor">271</a>).”</p>

<p>Some Judges and writers have very little respect for the
evidence and opinions of experts. An Iowa Judge says,
observation and experience “teach that the evidence of
experts is of the very lowest order, and of the most unsatisfactory
kind.” One from Maine, speaks of “the vain
babblings and oppositions of science so called, which swell
the record of the testimony of experts when the hopes of a
party depend rather upon mystification than enlightenment.”
An Illinois Judge quotes a distinguished occupant of
the bench as saying, “if there was any kind of testimony not
only of no value, but even worse than that, it was in his
judgment that of medical experts.” Lord Campbell said,
“Hardly any weight is to be given to the evidence of
what are called scientific witnesses: they come with a
bias on their minds to support the cause in which they
are embarked” (<a id="fnanchor-272" href="#fn-272" class="fnanchor">272</a>). Taylor says, “Perhaps the testimony
which least deserves credit with a jury is that of skilled
witnesses. .&#160;.&#160;. Being zealous partisans their belief
becomes synonymous with faith as defined by the apostle,
and it too often is but the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen” (<a id="fnanchor-273" href="#fn-273" class="fnanchor">273</a>). On the other hand,
Best says, “It would not be easy to overrate the value of
the evidence given in many difficult and delicate enquiries,
not only by medical men and physiologists, but by learned
<span class="xxpn" id="p111">|111|</span>
and experienced persons in various branches of science,
art and trade” (<a id="fnanchor-274" href="#fn-274" class="fnanchor">274</a>). And many Judges have spoken of the
essential aid to courts and juries rendered by the opinion
of the experienced, skilful and scientific witness who has a
competent knowledge of the facts involved.</p>

<p>When one takes his place as an expert before a court, a
legal paradox is instituted on his behalf, by which he is
allowed to testify—not as to what he knows, but to what
he believes or forms an opinion upon, based necessarily on
probabilities of analogy as well as experience. Nothing is
required (in the absence of any statutory provision to the
contrary) to entitle any one to give evidence as a medical
witness, than that he has been educated in the science of
medicine; and this he may be by study without practice,
or by practice without study; it is not necessary that he
should be a physician, or have studied for one, nor be a
graduate, nor one licensed to practise, nor need he be or
have been a practitioner (<a id="fnanchor-275" href="#fn-275" class="fnanchor">275</a>). One may be competent to
testify as an expert, although his special knowledge of the
particular subject of enquiry has been derived from the
reading and study of standard authorities, and not from
experience or actual observation. But one cannot qualify
himself as an expert in a particular case merely by
devoting himself to the study of authorities for the purposes
of that case, when such reading and study is not in
the line of his special calling or profession and is entered
upon to enable him to testify in the case. In Vermont,
however, it has been held that mere education as a physician,
without some practice as such, is insufficient to qualify
one as an expert; and in Arkansas, it is said, that competency
must be shewn from study and experience. In New
York, it has been held that one otherwise qualified, who is
<span class="xxpn" id="p112">|112|</span>
a physician and surgeon, may give evidence, although not
in full practice at the time; this fact merely goes to affect
his credit (<a id="fnanchor-276" href="#fn-276" class="fnanchor">276</a>).</p>

<p>It is not necessary that the physician should have made
the particular disease involved in the enquiry a specialty;
medical men of practice and experience are experts, and
their opinions are admissible in evidence upon questions
that are strictly and legitimately embraced in their profession
and practice. If one has made the matter in question
a specialty, doubtless his opinion will be of more value
than if he has not; and it has been said, that one who has
devoted himself exclusively to one branch of his profession
cannot give evidence as an expert on another (<a id="fnanchor-277" href="#fn-277" class="fnanchor">277</a>). For
example, one not an oculist may speak as to the cause of
injuries to an eye; one who has not made diseases of the
mind a special study may give his opinion as to the existence
of insanity; one not a practical chemist or analyst,
but understanding the practical details of chemistry and
the means of detecting poisons, may testify as to the tests
in the chemical analysis of a stomach, and as to the tests
usually applied to detect poison (<a id="fnanchor-278" href="#fn-278" class="fnanchor">278</a>). The law will even
allow a physician to speak as to the length of time a mule
has been suffering from a disease (<a id="fnanchor-279" href="#fn-279" class="fnanchor">279</a>). But one who has
had no experience as to the effect upon health of illuminating
gas cannot testify in relation thereto as an expert (<a id="fnanchor-280" href="#fn-280" class="fnanchor">280</a>).
Nor can one who has for thirty years been exclusively
treating the insane be permitted to testify, as an expert, on
<span class="xxpn" id="p113">|113|</span>
the mental capacity of a person in the last stages of disease,
who has not been previously insane (<a id="fnanchor-281" href="#fn-281" class="fnanchor">281</a>).</p>

<p>To render the opinion of a witness competent evidence,
he must, in general, be in some way peculiarly qualified to
speak on the subject, and have knowledge not possessed by
the mass of persons of ordinary experience and intelligence (<a id="fnanchor-282" href="#fn-282" class="fnanchor">282</a>).
Upon this principle, a priest who had studied
physiology and psychology, in order that he might pass
upon the mental conditions of communicants in his church,
and who had so to decide daily, was permitted to speak as
to the mental state of a woman whom he had attended in
her last illness (<a id="fnanchor-283" href="#fn-283" class="fnanchor">283</a>).</p>

<p>It is a question of fact to be decided at the trial, by the
Court, whether a witness offered as an expert has the
necessary qualification (<a id="fnanchor-284" href="#fn-284" class="fnanchor">284</a>). And the matter cannot be
referred to the decision of the jury. The decision of the
Judge at the trial will not be interfered with by the Court,
except in a clear and strong case (<a id="fnanchor-285" href="#fn-285" class="fnanchor">285</a>).</p>

<p>Any one offered as an expert who cannot establish the
fact of special knowledge or skill, in the particular department
which he is called upon to illuminate, will be rejected.
A Court before permitting an expert to testify may examine
him, or hear evidence, to satisfy itself that the witness is
really what he assumes to be (<a id="fnanchor-286" href="#fn-286" class="fnanchor">286</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p114">|114|</span></p>

<p>“We find no test laid down,” says the Supreme Court of
Indiana, “by which we can determine with mathematical
precision just how much experience a witness must have
had, how expert, in short, he must be, to render him
competent to testify as an expert.” But it is for the Court
to decide, within the limits of a fair discretion, whether the
experience of the proposed expert has been such as to make
his opinions of any value; mere opportunities for special
observation will not be deemed sufficient (<a id="fnanchor-287" href="#fn-287" class="fnanchor">287</a>).</p>

<p>While the Court, or Judge, determines the competency of
the witness to testify as an expert, the weight to be accorded
to his testimony is for the jury to decide. The testimony
of an expert is to be weighed and tested like any other kind
of evidence, and is to receive just such credit as the jury
may think it entitled to. It is intended to enlighten their
minds, not control their judgment (<a id="fnanchor-288" href="#fn-288" class="fnanchor">288</a>). The jury are not
bound by the opinions of medical experts: they may weigh
their opinions like any other evidence. They may act
against the greater number of opinions and in favour of
the fewer; for the opinion of one expert may, on account
of his greater knowledge and experience on the subject, or
from his giving further details of the case, or more probable
reasons for his opinions, be of greater value to the jury than
the opposite opinions of several (<a id="fnanchor-289" href="#fn-289" class="fnanchor">289</a>).</p>

<p>Ordronaux holds that a physician, although confessedly
possessing the ordinary experience of his profession, may
<i>quoad</i> some particular problem in medical science not be
an expert in the best and most critical sense of the term.
<i>Non omnes omnia possumus.</i> Once received as an expert,
<span class="xxpn" id="p115">|115|</span>
the maxim “<i>Cuilibet in sua arte perito credendum est</i>,”
must be applied, and he cannot be contradicted by any
unskilled person (<a id="fnanchor-290" href="#fn-290" class="fnanchor">290</a>).</p>

<p>In 1869, the Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of
Appeal well said, that “the opinions of experts not founded
on science, but on a mere theory of morals or ethics, whether
given by professional or unprofessional men, are wholly
inadmissible as evidence.” Hence the opinion of even
physicians that no sane man in a Christian country would
commit suicide, not being founded on the science or
phenomena of the mind, but rather a theory of morals,
religion and future responsibility, is not evidence (<a id="fnanchor-291" href="#fn-291" class="fnanchor">291</a>).</p>

<p>In the matter of expert testimony, as in other matters,
the law does not recognize any particular school of medicine
to the exclusion of others. The popular axiom that doctors
differ is as true now as ever it was, and so long as it continues
to be so, it is impossible for the law to recognize any
class of practitioners, or the followers of any particular
system, or method of treatment, as exclusively entitled to
be regarded as “doctors” (<a id="fnanchor-292" href="#fn-292" class="fnanchor">292</a>).</p>

<p>The physician called to give evidence as an expert should
understand at the outset that he is not called to express
any opinion upon the merits of the case, but only on some
questions of science raised by the facts proved; that he
has no concern in the issue of the trial, and that whichever
side calls him he is in no wise the witness—much less
the advocate—of that side. He is truly an adviser of the
Court, an <i>amicus curiæ</i>, rather than a party interested in
the result of the trial. Balbus in his commentaries on the
code says, “<i>Medici proprie non sunt testes, sed est magis
judicium quam testimonium</i>.” Experts, no matter on what
<span class="xxpn" id="p116">|116|</span>
they testify, simply supply data, as to whose competency,
relevancy and weight, the Court is to judge, and as to
which the Court is finally to declare the law. Where the
facts testified to by experts are undisputed, and when they
are the results of a particular science or art, with which
such experts are familiar, then the Court accepts such
facts, and declares the law that therefrom springs; where
the facts are disputed then the jury is to determine where
the preponderance of proof lies. But when the testimony
of the expert touches either law or speculation, psychology
or ethics, then such testimony is to be received as mere
argument, which if admissible at all is to be treated simply
as if addressed to the judgment of the Court (<a id="fnanchor-293" href="#fn-293" class="fnanchor">293</a>).</p>

<p>In his examination in chief an expert may not only
give his opinion itself, but also the grounds and reasons of
it; in fact it has been held that it is his duty to state the
reasons of his opinion and the facts on which it is based,
and if it is not sustained by them it is entitled to little
weight (<a id="fnanchor-294" href="#fn-294" class="fnanchor">294</a>).</p>

<p>The opinion of a medical man is admissible upon, the
condition of the human system at any given time; the
nature and symptoms of disease; the nature and effects of
wounds; the cause of death; the cause or effect of an
injury; the character of the instrument with which a
wound was produced; the effect of a particular course of
treatment; the likelihood of recovery; the mental condition
of a person; and on similar subjects. For instance,
where one was indicted for endeavouring to procure abortion,
the opinion that the woman was pregnant at the time
is relevant (<a id="fnanchor-295" href="#fn-295" class="fnanchor">295</a>). Where the question was whether a certain
<span class="xxpn" id="p117">|117|</span>
blow was sufficient to cause death; or whether a wound
and fracture on the head was caused by a fall; or whether
the fractures of the skull were caused by a gun; or whether
a gun-shot wound caused death; the opinions of physicians
were held admissible (<a id="fnanchor-296" href="#fn-296" class="fnanchor">296</a>). The opinion of medical experts
will be received upon the question as to whether an abortion
has been performed, or whether certain drugs are abortives,
or certain instruments adapted to produce an abortion (<a id="fnanchor-297" href="#fn-297" class="fnanchor">297</a>).
Experts may testify, after having made a chemical analysis
of the contents of the stomach, as to the presence of poison
in the body; and, without such analysis of a mixture, a
chemist may speak of its ingredients (<a id="fnanchor-298" href="#fn-298" class="fnanchor">298</a>). Those accustomed
to make chemical and microscopic examinations of
blood and blood stains may speak as to whether certain
stains are made by human or other blood. So, too, they
may speak as to the ink in questions as to handwriting (<a id="fnanchor-299" href="#fn-299" class="fnanchor">299</a>).
So, too, they may be asked their opinions touching the
permanency of any injury forming the subject of an action.
Also, in an action for damages against a railway company,
a physician may be asked at what period after the injury
the plaintiff would be most likely to improve, if he were
going to recover at all (<a id="fnanchor-300" href="#fn-300" class="fnanchor">300</a>). Where Barber sued Meriam for
injury to his wife, and she had been treated professionally
for some weeks by Dr. H., the opinion of another physician
as to the effect of Dr. H.’s treatment was considered
<span class="xxpn" id="p118">|118|</span>
admissible (<a id="fnanchor-301" href="#fn-301" class="fnanchor">301</a>). And so in a case of malpractice a medical
man may be asked whether the practice pursued was good
practice (<a id="fnanchor-302" href="#fn-302" class="fnanchor">302</a>). He may be asked as to the nature and
properties of the medicines employed by another
physician in the case in question; also, as to the practice
with regard to consultations; also, whether, in his opinion,
a patient’s death was or was not the result of neglect or want
of skill on the part of the attending physician (<a id="fnanchor-303" href="#fn-303" class="fnanchor">303</a>). But he
cannot be asked his opinion as to the general skill of the
physician on trial; nor the general reputation of the
school which the doctor in trouble attended; nor can he
say whether, from all the evidence in the case, the defendant
was guilty of malpractice, for that is the question for
the jury; nor can he say whether a physician has honorably
and faithfully discharged his duty to his professional
brethren (<a id="fnanchor-304" href="#fn-304" class="fnanchor">304</a>).</p>

<p>It has been held that a medical witness may give his
opinion upon new and hitherto unknown cases whenever
he swears that he can form such an opinion, even though
at the same time he should admit that precisely such a
case had never before fallen under his observation, nor
under his notice in the books. The man of science is
distinguished from the empiric in nothing more than in
not relying on specifics, and also not waiting for the exact
similitudes in things material and immaterial before forming
a judgment as to their similarity (<a id="fnanchor-305" href="#fn-305" class="fnanchor">305</a>).</p>

<p>It must always be remembered that medical men, when
called as skilled witnesses, may only say what, in their
judgment, would be the result of certain facts submitted
to their consideration, and may not give an opinion as to
<span class="xxpn" id="p119">|119|</span>
the general merits of the case, nor on the very point which
the jury has to determine, nor on things with which a jury
may be supposed to be equally well acquainted (<a id="fnanchor-306" href="#fn-306" class="fnanchor">306</a>).</p>

<p>As a recent writer puts it, a medical man cannot testify
as to matters not of skill in his profession, nor conclusions,
nor inferences which it is the duty of the jury to draw for
themselves. For instance, it was held that in a trial for
murder the opinions of the surgeons as to the probable
position of the deceased, when he received the blows which
caused his death, are incompetent. The Judge said that
he was not aware that surgeons were experts in the manner
of giving blows of the description in question, or determining
how the head must be placed so as most conveniently
to receive them (<a id="fnanchor-307" href="#fn-307" class="fnanchor">307</a>). Whenever the subject matter of the
enquiry is of such a character that it may be presumed to
lie within the common experience of all men of common
education, moving in ordinary walks of life, the rule is that
the opinions of experts are inadmissible, as the jury are
supposed—in all such matters—to be entirely competent
to draw the necessary inferences from the facts spoken of
by the witnesses (<a id="fnanchor-308" href="#fn-308" class="fnanchor">308</a>). Nor was the opinion of a medical
witness admitted where the question, in an action for libel,
was whether a physician in refusing to consult with the
plaintiff had honorably and faithfully discharged his duty
to the medical profession. The Judge said, the jury having
all the facts before them were as capable of forming a
judgment upon that point as the witness himself. Nor can
an expert give an opinion of the opinion of another expert (<a id="fnanchor-309" href="#fn-309" class="fnanchor">309</a>).
A medical man is considered an expert on the subject of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p120">|120|</span>
value of medical services (<a id="fnanchor-310" href="#fn-310" class="fnanchor">310</a>). But he is not so considered
when the question is one as to the amount of damages for
a breach of contract not to practise physic in a certain
town (<a id="fnanchor-311" href="#fn-311" class="fnanchor">311</a>).</p>

<p>The rule as to excluding experts from the court room
during the examination of witnesses has been laid down,
in England, thus: “Medical or other professional witnesses,
who are summoned to give scientific opinions upon
the circumstances of the case, as established by other
testimony, will be permitted to remain in court until this
particular class of evidence commences; but then, like
ordinary witnesses, they will have to withdraw, and to come
in one by one, so as to undergo a separate examination.”
And in the United States the principle is similarly stated (<a id="fnanchor-312" href="#fn-312" class="fnanchor">312</a>).</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="p121"
title="Chapter IX. Experts in Insanity Cases.">CHAPTER IX.
<span class="smallerblk">EXPERTS IN INSANITY CASES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The opinion evidence of medical men in questions of
insanity is not, as a rule, looked upon with any very great
degree of favor by the courts who have to decide upon the
competency, relevancy and weight of the opinions uttered.
Chapman, C.J., of Massachusetts, in charging a jury said,
“While they afford great aid in determining facts, it often
happens that experts can be found to testify to anything
however absurd” (<a id="fnanchor-313" href="#fn-313" class="fnanchor">313</a>). In another insanity case another
Judge remarked, “Experience has shown that opposite
opinions of persons professing to be experts may be obtained
to any amount, and it often occurs that not only many days
but many weeks are consumed in cross-examinations to
test the skill and knowledge of such witnesses, and to test
the correctness of their opinions,” (this was the case to a
great degree in the well known Guiteau prosecution,) “thus
wasting time and wearying the patience of both Court and
jury, perplexing, instead of elucidating, the question involved
in the issue” (<a id="fnanchor-314" href="#fn-314" class="fnanchor">314</a>). As to the perplexing instead of elucidating,
a writer of the highest authority gives the following, “In
a case of alleged child murder a medical witness, being
asked for a plain opinion of the cause of death, said, that
it was owing to ‘atelectasis and a general engorgement of
the pulmonary tissue’.” And in a trial for an assault a
<span class="xxpn" id="p122">|122|</span>
surgeon, in giving his evidence, informed the Court “that
on examining the prosecutor, he found him suffering from
a severe contusion of the integument under the left orbit,
with great extravasation of blood and ecchymosis in the
surrounding cellular tissue, which was in a tumefied state,
and there was also considerable abrasion of the cuticle.”
The Judge said, “You mean, I suppose, that the man had
a bad black eye.” “Yes.” “Then why not say so at
once” (<a id="fnanchor-315" href="#fn-315" class="fnanchor">315</a>).</p>

<p>Redfield, C.J., in his book on Wills, says, “Experience
has shown both here and in England that medical experts
differ quite as widely in their inferences and opinions as do
other witnesses. This has become so uniform a result
with the medical experts of late that they are beginning to
be regarded much in the light of hired advocates, and their
testimony as nothing more than a studied argument in
favor of the side for which they have been called. So
uniformly has this been proved in our experience that it
would excite scarcely less surprise to find an expert called
on one side testifying in any particular in favor of the
other side, than to find the counsel upon either side arguing
against their clients and in favor of their antagonists” (<a id="fnanchor-316" href="#fn-316" class="fnanchor">316</a>).</p>

<p>A Lord Chancellor once remarked that his experience
taught him that there were very few cases of insanity in
which any good came from the examination of medical
men. Their evidence sometimes adorned a case, and gave
rise to very agreeable and interesting scientific discussions,
but after all they have little or no weight with the jury.
And Mr. Justice Davis, of the Supreme Court of Maine,
after stating that he thought juries far more trust-worthy
than experts on the subject of insanity, said, “if there is
any kind of testimony that is not only of no value but
<span class="xxpn" id="p123">|123|</span>
even worse than that, it is in my judgment that of medical
experts. They may be able to state the diagnosis of the
disease more learnedly, but upon the question whether it
had, at a given time, reached such a stage that the subject
of it was incapable of making a contract, or irresponsible
for his acts, the opinion of his neighbors, if men of good
common sense, would be worth more than that of all the
experts in the country” (<a id="fnanchor-317" href="#fn-317" class="fnanchor">317</a>). There is scarcely a single
hypothesis as to responsibility (on the part of the insane),
no matter how wild, which, among the large number of
experts who have concerned themselves with this branch
of study, has not its advocates. So says Wharton in his
valuable treatise on Mental Unsoundness (<a id="fnanchor-318" href="#fn-318" class="fnanchor">318</a>); or as Cicero
elegantly put it long ago, “<i>nihil tam absurde dici potest,
quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum</i>” (<a id="fnanchor-319" href="#fn-319" class="fnanchor">319</a>).</p>

<p>Considering these things, one is not surprised at Campbell,
C.J., in the Bambridge case, saying to three medical men
who had recorded their opinions in favor of the insanity of
the testator: “You may go home to your patients, and I
wish you may be more usefully employed there, than you
have been here;” and to the jury he remarked, “We have
had during the trial the evidence of three medical witnesses,
and I think they might as well have stayed at home and
attended to their patients.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, Shaw, C.J., said, “such opinions (as
to sanity, etc.) when they come from persons of experience,
and in whose correctness and sobriety of judgment just
confidence can be had, are of great weight, and deserve the
respectful consideration of a jury. But the opinion of a
medical man of small experience, or of one who has crude
and visionary notions, or who has some favorite theory to
<span class="xxpn" id="p124">|124|</span>
support is entitled to very little consideration. The value
of such testimony will depend mainly upon the experience,
fidelity and impartiality of the witness who gives it” (<a id="fnanchor-320" href="#fn-320" class="fnanchor">320</a>).
And Chief Justice Gibson speaks with just emphasis of the
the deference due, in their own department, to the knowledge
obtained by men of a subject with which they have
grappled all their lives (<a id="fnanchor-321" href="#fn-321" class="fnanchor">321</a>). The Supreme Court of Texas
declared, “The opinions of medical men (on questions of
insanity) are received with great respect and consideration,
and properly so.” The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
says, “It is well settled that the knowledge and experience
of medical experts is of great value in questions of insanity.”
Equally strong are the utterances of the Court of Appeals
of West Virginia and the Supreme Court of North Carolina (<a id="fnanchor-322" href="#fn-322" class="fnanchor">322</a>).</p>

<p>Where the point in question is the sanity of a person,
the opinion of a medical man on the subject is, of course,
admissible when that opinion is drawn from personal
observation. This is the rule both in England and the
United States (<a id="fnanchor-323" href="#fn-323" class="fnanchor">323</a>). But a medical man may also give his
opinion on this subject, even though he has no knowledge
of the person whose sanity is in question (<a id="fnanchor-324" href="#fn-324" class="fnanchor">324</a>). It has been
suggested, that when a physician is asked his opinion on
the facts stated by other witnesses, he should be first
examined as to the particular symptoms of insanity; and as
to whether all or any, and which of the circumstances spoken
of by the witnesses upon the trial are to be regarded as
<span class="xxpn" id="p125">|125|</span>
such symptoms; then inquire of him whether any and
what combination of these circumstances would, in his
opinion, amount to proof of insanity (<a id="fnanchor-325" href="#fn-325" class="fnanchor">325</a>).</p>

<p>It has been held to be improper to ask a medical witness
whether the person, whose sanity was in question, possessed
sufficient capacity to make a will, or to transact business,
as these are matters of law, depending on the nature
of the business (<a id="fnanchor-326" href="#fn-326" class="fnanchor">326</a>). In England such witnesses can only
speak as to the state of mind, not as to the responsibility
of a prisoner; this latter point is for the jury under the
direction of the Judge (<a id="fnanchor-327" href="#fn-327" class="fnanchor">327</a>). So, on the plea of insanity at the
time of making a contract, the opinion of the medical man
who gave the certificate on which the defendant was confined
as insane at or about the time, is only evidence for the
jury, who must judge of the grounds upon which it was
formed (<a id="fnanchor-328" href="#fn-328" class="fnanchor">328</a>).</p>

<p>In England, an expert cannot be asked, after being present
at the whole trial, whether the defendant was insane, or
whether the act complained of was an insane act, because
these are questions for the jury and the witness must not
be placed in the jury’s place; but he may be asked whether
such and such appearances, proved by other witnesses, are
in his judgment symptoms of insanity (<a id="fnanchor-329" href="#fn-329" class="fnanchor">329</a>). The particular
facts proven by other witnesses may be taken and the expert
may be asked “assuming these facts to be true, do they in
your judgment indicate insanity on the part of the defendant
at the time the alleged act was committed?” (<a id="fnanchor-330" href="#fn-330" class="fnanchor">330</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p126">|126|</span></p>

<p>As a rule the Court should not allow an expert to give
his opinion upon facts proved by a witness unless he has
heard all the testimony of the witness, because the entire
testimony may be necessary in order to enable him to form an
opinion in regard to the subject matter of inquiry (<a id="fnanchor-331" href="#fn-331" class="fnanchor">331</a>).</p>

<p>Where the facts are disputed, experts can only be questioned
as to their opinion of a party’s sanity on a hypothetical
case, or as to certain designated facts existing in
the case supposing them to be true (<a id="fnanchor-332" href="#fn-332" class="fnanchor">332</a>).</p>

<p>The mode in which this hypothetical question is to be put
has been much considered. In England, in the celebrated
<i>Macnaghten</i> case in answer to an inquiry of the House of
Lords, whether “a medical man conversant with the disease
of insanity, who never saw the prisoner previously to the
trial, but who was present during the whole trial and the
examination of the witnesses, can be asked his opinion as to
the state of the prisoner’s mind at the time of the commission
of the alleged crime; or his opinion whether the
prisoner was conscious at the time of doing the act, that
he was acting contrary to the law; or whether he was
labouring under any and what delusion at the time?” The
twelve judges replied, “We think the medical man, under
the circumstances supposed, cannot in strictness be asked
his opinion in the terms above stated, because each of these
questions involves the determination of the facts deposed
to, which it is for the jury to decide, and the questions are
not mere questions upon a matter of science in which case
such evidence is admissible. But where the facts are
admitted or not disputed, and the question becomes
substantially one of science only, it may be convenient to
<span class="xxpn" id="p127">|127|</span>
allow the question to be put in that general form, though
the same cannot be insisted on as a matter of right (<a id="fnanchor-333" href="#fn-333" class="fnanchor">333</a>).”</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, Chief Justice Shaw said, “The proper
question to be put to the professional witness is this—If the
symptoms and indications testified to by the other witnesses
are proved and if the jury are satisfied of the truth of them,
whether in their opinion the party was insane, and what
was the nature and character of that insanity; what state
of mind did they indicate; and what they would expect
would be the conduct of such person in any supposed
circumstances?” (<a id="fnanchor-334" href="#fn-334" class="fnanchor">334</a>).</p>

<p>In another well known case, the Judge said to the jury,
“It is not the province of the expert to draw inferences of
facts from the evidence, but simply to declare his opinion
on a known, or hypothetical state of facts, and therefore
the counsel on each side have put to the physicians such
states of fact as they deem warranted by the evidence, and
have taken their opinions thereon. If you consider any of
these states of facts put to the medical witnesses are proved,
then the opinions thereon are admissible evidence, to be
weighed by you, otherwise their opinions are not applicable
to the case” (<a id="fnanchor-335" href="#fn-335" class="fnanchor">335</a>).</p>

<p>The opinions of both experts and non-experts should
have weight according to their opportunities and qualifications
for examination of the state of mind of the person
whose sanity is in question. First of all will be the family,
or the physician who has attended the patient through the
disease which is supposed to have disabled his mind; next
are those who, without special learning on the subject, have
had the best opportunities for judging—the members of his
family and those whose intimacy in the family, have given
them opportunities of seeing the patient at all times and
<span class="xxpn" id="p128">|128|</span>
noticing the alienation of his mind; and last, come those
who only occasionally and at intervals have seen him, and
whose chances of studying his moods have been small (<a id="fnanchor-336" href="#fn-336" class="fnanchor">336</a>).</p>

<p>It has been held, in Massachusetts, that a physician who
had not made insanity a special subject, and who, when
consulted in such matters, always called in a specialist,
is not competent to give an opinion on an hypothetical
case put to him, unless he was the person’s attending
physician; then his opinion is received, as it is his duty to
make himself acquainted with the peculiarities, bodily and
mental, of a person who is the subject of his care and
advice (<a id="fnanchor-337" href="#fn-337" class="fnanchor">337</a>). And where a physician had for more than
thirty years been exclusively treating the insane, he was
not permitted to testify, as an expert, to the mental
capacity of a person—not previously insane—who was in
the last stages of disease (<a id="fnanchor-338" href="#fn-338" class="fnanchor">338</a>).</p>

<p>One not an expert may give an opinion, founded on
observation, as to whether a person is sane or insane,
not­with­stand­ing the general rule, that persons not medical
men cannot give their opinions as to the existence, nature
or extent of disease in any one. The exception was first
introduced in regard to the subscribing witnesses to a will,
who were permitted to speak as to the testator’s state of
mind; it has now been extended to all cases where the witness’
acquaintance with the party whose sanity is in dispute,
or his means of observation, are sufficient to enable him
to express his opinion as to the mental condition. The
Courts of Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and
Texas, however, still adhere to the old rule and admit the
evidence of non-experts only in cases of wills (<a id="fnanchor-339" href="#fn-339" class="fnanchor">339</a>).</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="p129"
title="Chapter X. Defamation.">CHAPTER X.
<span class="smallerblk">DEFAMATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>No man may disparage the reputation of another. Every
one has a right to have his good name maintained, unimpaired.
Words which produce any perceptible injury to
the reputation of another are called defamatory: and if
they are false they are actionable. False and malicious
defamatory words, if in printing, writing, pictures or signs,
and published, constitute a libel; if spoken, a slander. A
caricature may be a libel; so may a chalk-mark on a
wall, a statue, hieroglyphics, a rebus, an anagram or an
allegory, or even ironical praise.</p>

<p>Defamatory matter, whether published in the form of
libel or slander, is actionable when it imputes a criminal
offence (or a contagious or infectious disorder) or affects the
plaintiff injuriously in his lawful profession, trade or
business, or in the discharge of a public office, or generally
when it is false and malicious, and its publication causes
damage to the plaintiff either in law or in fact. Defamatory
matter, the publication of which tends to degrade or
disparage the plaintiff, or which renders him ridiculous, or
charges him with want of honesty, humanity or veracity, or
is intended to impair his enjoyment of society, fortune or
comfort, is actionable as libel, but not as slander, unless
special damage be proved (<a id="fnanchor-340" href="#fn-340" class="fnanchor">340</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p130">|130|</span></p>

<p>The person defamed by a libel has not only a civil remedy
to recover damages but he may also, in some cases, proceed
criminally by way of information or indictment and have
the defamer punished as an offender against the state. If
he proceeds by information he must in general waive his
right to bring a civil action; but he may sue for damages
after the offender has been convicted upon an indictment.
An action for libel must be brought within six years; and
an action for slander within two years, unless the words
spoken are actionable only by reason of special damage, in
which case the action may be brought at any time within
six years.</p>

<p>Whenever a special kind of knowledge is essential to the
proper conduct of a particular profession, denying that a
man possesses such special knowledge will be actionable if
he belongs to that particular profession, but not otherwise.
Thus to say of a physician, “Thou art a drunken fool and an
ass. Thou wert never a scholar, nor even able to speak like
a scholar,” is actionable, because no man can be a good
physician unless he be a scholar (<a id="fnanchor-341" href="#fn-341" class="fnanchor">341</a>). Although one may
with impunity say of a Justice of the Peace, “He is a fool,
an ass and a beetle headed justice” (<a id="fnanchor-342" href="#fn-342" class="fnanchor">342</a>). So to say, of a midwife,
“Many have perished for her want of skill;” or,
“She is an ignorant woman, and of small practice and
very unfortunate in her way; there are few she goes to
but lie desperately ill, or die under her hands;” is actionable (<a id="fnanchor-343" href="#fn-343" class="fnanchor">343</a>).
Or of an apothecary, “He is not an apothecary;
he has not passed any examination. Several have
died that he had attended, and there have been inquests held
upon them” (<a id="fnanchor-344" href="#fn-344" class="fnanchor">344</a>). Although one may safely say of a Justice
of the Peace, “He is a blood sucker, and sucketh blood.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p131">|131|</span></p>

<p>It is actionable to say of a person in his professional
character, “He is no doctor; he bought his diploma for
$50” (<a id="fnanchor-345" href="#fn-345" class="fnanchor">345</a>). Any words imputing to a practising medical
man, misconduct or incapacity in the discharge of his
professional duties, are actionable <i>per se</i>. Thus, it is actionable,
without proof of special damage, to accuse one of
having caused the death of any patient through his
ignorance or culpable negligence, as to say of a physician,
“He killed my child by giving it too much calomel,” or,
“He hath killed J. S. with physic, which physic was a
pill;” or, “He was the death of J. P.; he has killed his
patient with physic; it is a world of blood he has to answer
for in this town through his ignorance; he did kill a woman
and two children at Southampton; he did kill J. P. at
Petersfield;” or, as an American did, “Dr. S. killed my
children; he gave them teaspoonful doses of calomel, and
it killed them. They did not live long after they took it.
They died right off the same day” (<a id="fnanchor-346" href="#fn-346" class="fnanchor">346</a>).</p>

<p>So it is to say of an apothecary, “He poisoned my
uncle; I will have him digged up again, and hang him,”
or, “He killed my child; it was the saline injection that
did it;” or, “I was told he had given my child too much
mercury, and poisoned it; otherwise, it would have got
well” (<a id="fnanchor-347" href="#fn-347" class="fnanchor">347</a>).</p>

<p>So it is actionable to say of a surgeon and accoucheur,
“He is a bad character; none of the medical men here
will meet him.” As such words impart the want of a
necessary qualification for a surgeon in the ordinary discharge
of his professional duties; or, “Dr. Tweedie has
honorably and faithfully discharged his duties to his
<span class="xxpn" id="p132">|132|</span>
medical brethren in refusing to act or consult with Ramadge (a
physician), and we hope every one else will do the same” (<a id="fnanchor-348" href="#fn-348" class="fnanchor">348</a>).
Or to call a practising medical man “a quack,” “a quacksalver,”
“an empiric,” or “a mountebank,” or to say of
him, “Thou gavest physic which thou knewest to be contrary
to the disease,” or “Thou art no good subject, for
thou poisonedst A. F.’s wound, to get more money of him.”
Under the New York Statutes, a homœopathic physician may
maintain an action for being called a quack (<a id="fnanchor-349" href="#fn-349" class="fnanchor">349</a>). And it
seems that an action will lie, without averment of special
damages, for slander imputing to a physician, that he has
taken advantage of his character as a physician to abuse
the confidence reposed in him, and commit acts of criminal
conversation with a patient (<a id="fnanchor-350" href="#fn-350" class="fnanchor">350</a>).</p>

<p>In the case of libel, any words will be presumed defamatory
which expose the plaintiff to hatred, contempt, ridicule
or obloquy, which tend to injure him in his professional
trade, or cause him to be shunned or avoided by his neighbours.
Thus, to advertise falsely that certain quack
medicines, “consumption pills,” were prepared by a physician
of eminence, is a libel upon such physician (<a id="fnanchor-351" href="#fn-351" class="fnanchor">351</a>).</p>

<p>Whenever a medical man brings forward some new method
of treatment and advertises it largely as the best, or only
cure for some particular disease, or for all diseases at once,
he may be said to invite public attention, and a newspaper
writer is justified in warning the public against such advertisers,
and in exposing the absurdity of their professions,
provided he does so fairly and with reasonable judgment (<a id="fnanchor-352" href="#fn-352" class="fnanchor">352</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p133">|133|</span>
A medical man, who had obtained a diploma and the degree
of M.D., from an American College, advertised in England
most extensively a new and infallible cure for consumption.
The <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> published a leading article on these
advertisements, in which they called the advertiser a quack
and an impostor, and compared him to scoundrels “who
pass bad coin.” This was considered as overstepping the
limits of fair criticism, and a verdict was given for the
plaintiff, with damages, one farthing (<a id="fnanchor-353" href="#fn-353" class="fnanchor">353</a>). So where the
editor of the <i>Lancet</i> attacked the editor of a rival paper,
<i>The London Medical and Physical Journal</i>, by rancorous
aspersions on his private character, not fairly called for by
what the plaintiff had done as an editor, the plaintiff
recovered a verdict of £5 (<a id="fnanchor-354" href="#fn-354" class="fnanchor">354</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is not actionable to say of a surgeon,
“He did poison the wound of his patient,” without some
averment that this was improper treatment, for it might be
proper for the cure of it. Nor to say of an apothecary,
“He made up the medicine for my child wrong, through
jealousy, because I would not allow him to use his own
judgment” (<a id="fnanchor-355" href="#fn-355" class="fnanchor">355</a>). Nor to charge a physician or surgeon with
“malpractice,” if it appear that the word was not used or
understood in a technical sense; and to charge a physician
or surgeon with mere want of skill, or with ignorance or
neglect, is not actionable <i>per se</i>, though untrue, unless the
charge be of gross want of skill, or the like, so as to imply
general unfitness (<a id="fnanchor-356" href="#fn-356" class="fnanchor">356</a>).</p>

<p>Nor is it actionable to call a person who practises medicine
or surgery, without legal qualification, a “quack or an
<span class="xxpn" id="p134">|134|</span>
impostor,” for the law only protects lawful employment (<a id="fnanchor-357" href="#fn-357" class="fnanchor">357</a>).
Even though a medical man be duly registered in Great
Britain, still, if he is practising in a colony which requires
registration without complying with the colonial law, he
may safely be called “a quack,” “a charlatan,” “a
scoundrel not to be entrusted with the lives of people” (<a id="fnanchor-358" href="#fn-358" class="fnanchor">358</a>).</p>

<p>Words imputing immoral conduct, profligacy or adultery,
even when spoken of one holding an office or carrying on a
profession or business, are not actionable unless they “touch
him” in that office, profession or business. Thus, if
adultery is alleged of a clergyman, it will be actionable,
because if the charge were true, it would be a ground
for degradation or deprivation, as it would prove him unfit
to hold his benefice, or to continue the active duties of his
profession. But if the same words are spoken of a physician,
they will not be actionable without proof of special
damage, as they do not necessarily affect the plaintiff in
relation to his trade or profession (<a id="fnanchor-359" href="#fn-359" class="fnanchor">359</a>).</p>

<p>Nor unless the words are spoken in connection with the
professional duties of the plaintiff will an action lie for
the words, “He is so steady drunk, he cannot get business
any more;” or “He is a twopenny bleeder” (<a id="fnanchor-360" href="#fn-360" class="fnanchor">360</a>).</p>

<p>It is no libel to write of a physician that he is in the
habit of meeting homœopathists in consultation (<a id="fnanchor-361" href="#fn-361" class="fnanchor">361</a>).</p>

<p>Where the plaintiff considers that the words spoken touch
him in his profession or trade, he must always aver in the
pleadings that he was carrying on the profession of a
physician or surgeon, or the trade of a druggist, at the
<span class="xxpn" id="p135">|135|</span>
time the words were spoken. Sometimes this is admitted
by the slander itself, and if so, evidence is of course
unnecessary in proof of this averment. But in other cases,
unless it is admitted on the pleadings, evidence must be
given at the trial of the special character in which the
plaintiff sues. As a rule, it is sufficient for the plaintiff to
prove that he was engaged in the profession or trade,
without proving any appointment thereto, or producing a
diploma or other formal qualification. For the maxim
<i>omnia presumuntur rite esse acta</i> applies. But if the very
slander complained of imputes to the medical practitioner
that he is a quack or an impostor, not legally qualified for
practice; or if the plaintiff aver that he is a physician and
has duly taken his degree, then the plaintiff at the trial
must be prepared to prove his qualification strictly by
producing his diploma or certificate. In some cases the mere
production of the diploma will not be sufficient proof of the
plaintiff’s having the degree, but it may be necessary to
prove that the seal affixed is the seal of a university having
power to grant degrees; or in the case of the production of
a copy of the diploma, that it has been compared with the
original (<a id="fnanchor-362" href="#fn-362" class="fnanchor">362</a>).</p>

<p>Whether or no the words were spoken of the plaintiff in
the way of his business is a question for the jury to determine
at the trial. There should always be an averment in
the statement of claim, that the words were so spoken, and
it should also be shewn in what manner the words were
connected by the speaker with the profession (<a id="fnanchor-363" href="#fn-363" class="fnanchor">363</a>).</p>

<p>Medical practitioners are of course equally liable with
other men to an action for defamation, in respect of any
<span class="xxpn" id="p136">|136|</span>
false and malicious communication, whether oral or written,
made by them to the damage of another, in law or in fact;
circumstances, however, frequently arise where, from the
nature of their employment, it becomes their duty or interest
to make some communication prejudicial to the character
or conduct of another, and in such cases, where the occasion
on which the communication was made rebuts the presumption
of malice, (which the law infers from such a statement,)
such communication is said to be privileged, and therefore,
in order to sustain an action for defamation, the plaintiff
must prove that the defendant was actuated by express or
actual malice—that is, malice independent of the occasion
on which the communication was made. The legal canon
is, that a communication made <i>bona fide</i>, upon any subject
matter in which the party communicating has an interest,
or in reference to which he has a duty, is privileged, if made
to a person having a corresponding interest or duty, although
it contains criminatory matter, which (without this privilege)
would be slanderous and actionable. This applies, moreover,
though the duty be not a legal one, but only a moral
or social duty of imperfect obligation, and also where the
communication is made to a person not in fact having such
interest or duty, but who might reasonably be, and is
supposed by the party making the communication to have
such interest or duty (<a id="fnanchor-364" href="#fn-364" class="fnanchor">364</a>). Even where the evidence of duty
is not present to the mind, but the speaker is impelled by a
sense of propriety, on which he does not pause to reflect, and
which he refers to no special motive, nevertheless, if his
conduct in speaking the words be within the occasion of
interest or of duty which is capable of protecting, the communication
will be considered privileged (<a id="fnanchor-365" href="#fn-365" class="fnanchor">365</a>).</p>

<p>Words spoken by the medical officer of a college concerning
<span class="xxpn" id="p137">|137|</span>
the meat furnished to the institution; and
words used by the medical attendant of a poor-law union about the wine
supplied to the inmates, are privileged, in the absence of proof of
actual malice (<a id="fnanchor-366" href="#fn-366" class="fnanchor">366</a>). A statement made by a physician that an unmarried
woman is pregnant is not a privileged communication, unless made in
good faith to one who is reasonably entitled to receive the information
(<a id="fnanchor-367" href="#fn-367" class="fnanchor">367</a>).</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="p138"
title="Chapter XI. Relations With Patients.">
CHAPTER XI.
<span class="smallerblk">RELATIONS WITH PATIENTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is a well settled doctrine that where one occupies a
position which naturally gives him the confidence of another,
or which in any way gives him an influence, or an undue
advantage over the other, transactions between them require
something more to give them validity than is necessary in
other cases. The mere fact of the existence of such a relationship
as naturally creates influence over the mind will
lead the courts to infer the probability of undue influence
having been exerted. Confidence has been held to imply the
opportunity for influence, and when established, dispenses
with any more direct proof of influence. In such cases the
<i>onus</i> is cast upon the person occupying such a relationship
to establish the perfect fairness and equity of the transaction.
He must shew that the other acted after full and sufficient
deliberation and with all the information that it was
material for him to have, in order to guide his conduct, and
that he had either independent and disinterested advice, or
as ample protection as such advice could have given
him (<a id="fnanchor-368" href="#fn-368" class="fnanchor">368</a>).
<i>Rhodes</i> v. <i>Bates</i>
(<a id="fnanchor-369" href="#fn-369" class="fnanchor">369</a>)
lays it down that the donor
must have had competent and independent advice.</p>

<p>The relation between a medical man and his patient is
one in which the probability of undue influence is inferred;
<span class="xxpn" id="p139">|139|</span>
and so in dealings with their patients the acts of physicians
are watched with great jealousy; not because the Court
blames and discountenances the influence flowing from such
relation, but because it holds that this influence should be
exerted for the benefit of the person subject to it, and not
for the advantage of the person possessing it (<a id="fnanchor-370" href="#fn-370" class="fnanchor">370</a>). The discontinuance
of the relationship is only material if the
influence has ceased with the relation; and the relation
does not necessarily cease because the patient has not
medicine actually administered to him at the time (<a id="fnanchor-371" href="#fn-371" class="fnanchor">371</a>).</p>

<p>Where a surgeon and apothecary obtained from a patient,
eighty-five years old, an agreement to pay him £25,000, in
consideration of past medical services, duly charged and paid
for, and the promise of future medical and surgical assistance
until death without charge, and kept the matter
concealed until after the death of the patient, the Court,
on the prayer of the patient’s executor, ordered the medical
man to give up the agreement to be cancelled. So, when
an octogenarian patient conveyed by deed of gift a property
worth £1,000 to his physician, who was also his intimate
friend, and the son of his benefactor, the Court set aside
the deed for fraud. (In this case the consideration named
in this deed was not the true one.) And even where a
patient gave to his surgeon an annuity of £100 for the surgeon’s
life, in consideration that he would live with him
and give him the benefit of his professional assistance
during his (the donor’s) life, it being shown that the surgeon
had been told by an eminent physician, just before the
deeds were drawn, that the patient could not recover or live
long, and that the surgeon himself, about the same time,
had said the patient could not live more than a month
or so; the Court held the instruments could not be
<span class="xxpn" id="p140">|140|</span>
maintained (<a id="fnanchor-372" href="#fn-372" class="fnanchor">372</a>). A patient, aged, feeble, deaf and of very
weak mind, bestowed all his estate on the attending physician,
who lived with him, and had controlling influence over
him, for an extremely trifling compensation. The transaction
was set aside, the Court saying: “Owing to the relation
which the parties sustained towards each other, the deed
was presumptively the result of undue influence, and therefore
<i>prima facie</i> void for that reason. It has been repeatedly
declared by learned chancellors that the mere relation
of patient and medical adviser was sufficient to avoid the
contracts of the former made with the latter during the
continuance of such relation” (<a id="fnanchor-373" href="#fn-373" class="fnanchor">373</a>).</p>

<p>A security given by an old man for £262 10<i>s.</i> to a dentist,
in consideration of his old teeth being kept in order and
new ones being supplied during the remainder of his life,
had to be given up (<a id="fnanchor-374" href="#fn-374" class="fnanchor">374</a>). And if a man pays an exorbitant
bill to a doctor, the Court will grant him relief; and it will
be no answer to his asking his money back to say that he
intended to be liberal, unless such intentions can be clearly
shown (<a id="fnanchor-375" href="#fn-375" class="fnanchor">375</a>). Even a sale to a patient by the medical man
under whose care he is will be set aside if at an exorbitant
price, and the purchaser has had no independent advice (<a id="fnanchor-376" href="#fn-376" class="fnanchor">376</a>).</p>

<p>But where the evidence showed that the patient’s own
attorney prepared the papers, that he had independent
advice, and understood what he was doing, and exercised
his free will, and that the medical man had long attended
him, the Court refused to set aside the deed, although
the patient was eighty years of age (<a id="fnanchor-377" href="#fn-377" class="fnanchor">377</a>). And although a
<span class="xxpn" id="p141">|141|</span>
gift made to a physician may be voidable, because of his
standing in a confidential relation to the donor, a patient,
yet, if after the confidential relation has ceased to exist,
the donor intentionally elects to abide by the gift, and does,
in fact, abide by it, it cannot be impeached after his death,
even if it is not proved that the patient was aware that the
gift was voidable at his election (<a id="fnanchor-378" href="#fn-378" class="fnanchor">378</a>).</p>

<p>There is, of course, nothing in the relation of medical
attendant and patient which can prevent the one from
entering into a contract with the other, where the transaction
proceeds openly and fairly, and the relation of physician
and patient has, in reality, no bearing upon it (<a id="fnanchor-379" href="#fn-379" class="fnanchor">379</a>).
In the case of a sale by a patient to a physician, where
there was no proof of inadequacy of price, the transaction
was sustained (<a id="fnanchor-380" href="#fn-380" class="fnanchor">380</a>).</p>

<p>A strong case must be made to set aside a will on the
ground of undue influence. Influence is not sufficient:
there must be such a degree of influence as deprives the
testator of the proper mastery over his faculties (<a id="fnanchor-381" href="#fn-381" class="fnanchor">381</a>). To
invalidate a will, on the ground of undue influence, it must
be shown that it was practised with respect to the will
itself, or so con­temp­or­an­eous­ly with the will, or connected
with it, as by almost necessary presumption to affect it;
and flattery and obsequiousness, however degrading, will
not constitute such an undue influence as will affect the
acts of a capable testatrix (<a id="fnanchor-382" href="#fn-382" class="fnanchor">382</a>). Many wills made in favour
of medical men by their patients have been sustained,
although disputed, and that even in cases where the patients
have been aged, infirm women, with impaired minds (<a id="fnanchor-383" href="#fn-383" class="fnanchor">383</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p142">|142|</span></p>

<p>A physician, however, may fail to obtain the benefits
which a grateful patient has wished him to have under a
will, if—as was done in one case—after a long attendance
on a patient, he thinks fit, when she is almost on her deathbed,
to prepare and procure the execution of a will by
which he becomes the principal object of her bounty, to
the exclusion of her near relatives; and to do this without
the intervention of any solicitor or other person competent
to give her advice, and to guard her against undue influence;
for in such a case the interests of the public require
that his conduct should be regarded by Courts of Justice
with the utmost jealousy (<a id="fnanchor-384" href="#fn-384" class="fnanchor">384</a>). In another case, it was said
that although there is no rule of law which forbids a man
to bequeath his property to his medical attendant, yet it is
not a favourable circumstance for one in such a confidential
position, with respect to a patient labouring under a severe
disease, to take a large benefit under such patient’s will,
more particularly, if it be executed in secrecy and the whole
transaction assumes the character of a clandestine proceeding,
and in such a case the <i>onus</i> will lie very heavily
upon the party benefited to maintain the validity of the
will (<a id="fnanchor-385" href="#fn-385" class="fnanchor">385</a>).</p>

<p>Clairvoyant physicians may also get into trouble. An
action was brought against one to set aside a marriage and
a conveyance of property worth $25,000. The patient was
old, feeble, deaf, childish and a firm spiritualist. The
clairvoyant was a woman who pretended to be very modest
and bashful and able to cure the deafness. After a course
of treatment, mainly by manipulation, she told the old man
that the spirits said that they must be married within two
weeks, or something dreadful “would step in between them.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p143">|143|</span>
By mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tions concerning her character and her
friends she won the old man and his property. After the
honeymoon the patient came to his senses, and prayed to
get back his liberty and possessions, because of the fraud
used. The Court granted his prayer (<a id="fnanchor-386" href="#fn-386" class="fnanchor">386</a>).</p>

<p>To promise a cure is unprofessional, and to obtain money
on the faith of such a promise is sometimes dangerous.
Brown falsely represented himself to A., an ignorant negro,
to be a practising physician, and that he had restored sight
to the blind. He persuaded A. that his (A.’s) house was
infected with poison, and that it was in the bed occupied
by his granddaughter, that she was poisoned, and that he
could remove the poison if he was paid for so doing. A.
gave him $22 to remove it. The Court held that Brown
had been guilty of obtaining money under false pretences (<a id="fnanchor-387" href="#fn-387" class="fnanchor">387</a>).</p>

<p>A physician should take all possible care to prevent the
spread of smallpox or any other contagious disease, and use
all such precautionary measures as may appear desirable.
So, where the paper upon the walls of a room in which
there had been smallpox patients had become so soiled and
smeared with the smallpox virus as to make its removal
necessary, a physician or other attendant may order the
paper to be torn down; and the landlord cannot successfully
maintain an action against the physician for doing
this (<a id="fnanchor-388" href="#fn-388" class="fnanchor">388</a>).</p>

<p>Apparently a surgeon may retain the limbs he cuts off a
patient, upon the ground that parts of the body when
severed become dead, and at common law there is no
property in a dead human body. The point was once contested
in Washington (<a id="fnanchor-389" href="#fn-389" class="fnanchor">389</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p144">|144|</span></p>

<p>A surgeon who attends a duel, although to save by his
skill if possible the lives therein imperilled, will be held
guilty of aiding and abetting the principal offender in the
event of death ensuing (<a id="fnanchor-390" href="#fn-390" class="fnanchor">390</a>).</p>

<p>If a medical practitioner wilfully injures a patient he is
liable to be indicted for an assault, and if death ensue from
the injuries so inflicted he may be indicted for murder.
And this is so even though the patient might have submitted
at the time from the supposition that the treatment
was for his good. Having or attempting to have carnal
connection with a female patient under pretence of treating
her medically is an assault (<a id="fnanchor-391" href="#fn-391" class="fnanchor">391</a>). Making a female patient
strip naked, under pretence that the defendant, a medical
practitioner, cannot otherwise judge of her illness, if he
himself takes off her clothes, contrary to her wishes, is an
assault. In this case the jury found that the defendant
had stripped the girl wantonly, and not from any belief
that it was necessary (<a id="fnanchor-392" href="#fn-392" class="fnanchor">392</a>).</p>

<p>Where a physician takes an unprofessional unmarried
man with him to attend a case of confinement, and no real
necessity exists for the latter’s assistance or presence, both
are liable for damages; and it makes no difference that the
patient, or her husband, supposed at the time that the
intruder was a medical man, and therefore submitted
without objection to his presence; or that the intruder
accompanied the physician reluctantly on a dark and
stormy night to carry a lantern or umbrella, and some
instruments, and that there was only one room in the
house. The Court remarked: “Dr. De May therefore took
an unprofessional young unmarried man with him, introduced
and permitted him to remain in the house of the
plaintiff, when it was apparent that he could hear at least,
<span class="xxpn" id="p145">|145|</span>
if not see, all that was said and done, and, as the jury
must have found under the instructions given, without
either the plaintiff or her husband having any knowledge
or reason to believe the true character of the third party.
It would be shocking to our sense of right, justice and
propriety even to doubt that for such an act the law would
afford an ample remedy. To the plaintiff the occasion was
a most sacred one, and no one had a right to intrude unless
invited, or because of some real and pressing necessity
which it is not pretended existed in this case. The plaintiff
had a legal right to the privacy of her apartment at
such a time, and the law secures to her this right by
requiring others to observe it and to abstain from its
violation. The fact that at the time she consented to the
presence of Scattergood, supposing him to be a physician,
does not preclude her from maintaining an action, and
recovering substantial damages upon afterward ascertaining
his true character. In obtaining admission at such a time
and under such circumstances, without fully disclosing his
true character, both parties were guilty of deceit, and the
wrong thus done entitles the injured party to recover the
damages afterward sustained, from shame and mortification,
upon discovering the true character of the defendants.”
The action was brought by the wife (<a id="fnanchor-393" href="#fn-393" class="fnanchor">393</a>).</p>

<p>If physicians, who have certified to the insanity of a
person, have not made the enquiry and examination which
the statute requires, or if their evidence and certificate in
any respect of form or substance are not sufficient to justify
a commitment to an asylum, the authorities should not
commit, and if they do it is their fault and not that of
the physicians, provided the latter have stated facts and
opinions truly and have acted with due professional care
and skill (<a id="fnanchor-394" href="#fn-394" class="fnanchor">394</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p146">|146|</span></p>

<p>If a medical man takes upon himself the responsibility
of imprisoning a person on the ground of insanity, upon
mere statements made to him by others, he will be liable
to an action, and also for an assault, unless he can indeed
show that the party imprisoned was insane at the time (<a id="fnanchor-395" href="#fn-395" class="fnanchor">395</a>).
He is not liable for an assault if he has signed a certificate
under the Lunacy Acts and has done nothing more towards
causing the confinement of the alleged lunatic (<a id="fnanchor-396" href="#fn-396" class="fnanchor">396</a>). A
medical man or other person may justify an assault where
it is committed for the purpose of putting a restraint
upon a dangerous lunatic in such a state that it is likely
he may do mischief to some one (<a id="fnanchor-397" href="#fn-397" class="fnanchor">397</a>).</p>

<p>In Ontario, except under order of the Lieutenant-Governor,
no one can be admitted into a lunatic asylum without
the certificate of three medical men, each attested by the
signatures of two subscribing witnesses. Their certificates
must state a personal and separate examination, and that
after due enquiry the patient was found insane; and the
physicians must also specify the facts upon which they
formed their opinion of the insanity. In England, except
in the case of paupers, two certificates are required (<a id="fnanchor-398" href="#fn-398" class="fnanchor">398</a>).</p>

<p>The practice of abortion is forbidden by the oath of
Hippocrates. The act is recognized as a crime in almost
every code of medical ethics: its known commission has
always been followed by ignominious expulsion from medical
fellowship and fraternity. At Common Law a child <i>en
ventre sa mere</i> is not considered a person the killing of
whom is murder; but if one, intending to procure abortion,
causes a child to be born so soon that it cannot live, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p147">|147|</span>
it dies in consequence, it is murder (<a id="fnanchor-399" href="#fn-399" class="fnanchor">399</a>). And it is murder
if one, attempting to procure abortion, either by means of
drugs or instruments, cause the death of the woman (<a id="fnanchor-400" href="#fn-400" class="fnanchor">400</a>).</p>

<p>In most civilized countries it is now either a felony, or
grave misdemeanor, to attempt to procure the miscarriage
of a woman by any means; or to supply or procure any
thing knowing that it is intended to be unlawfully used or
employed to procure a miscarriage (<a id="fnanchor-401" href="#fn-401" class="fnanchor">401</a>). In some States
the crime of abortion may be committed at any stage of
pregnancy (<a id="fnanchor-402" href="#fn-402" class="fnanchor">402</a>). The thing prescribed must be noxious in
its nature, but it is not necessary to prove that it will
produce miscarriage (<a id="fnanchor-403" href="#fn-403" class="fnanchor">403</a>).</p>

<p>The burden of shewing that the use of instruments to
produce abortion was necessary to save the life of the
woman is on the accused (<a id="fnanchor-404" href="#fn-404" class="fnanchor">404</a>).</p>

<p>It is an indictable offence for a physician, or any one
else, unlawfully and injuriously to carry along or to expose
in a public highway, on which persons are passing, and
near to the habitations of others, any person infected with
the small-pox, or any contagious disorder; and it is for
the accused to shew that the object of the carrying or
exposure was lawful (<a id="fnanchor-405" href="#fn-405" class="fnanchor">405</a>).</p>

<p>In England, since 1840, it has been an indictable offence
to innoculate for the small-pox (<a id="fnanchor-406" href="#fn-406" class="fnanchor">406</a>). So, too, it has been
in Canada for a number of years (<a id="fnanchor-407" href="#fn-407" class="fnanchor">407</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p148">|148|</span></p>

<p>It has been held in the State of Alabama, that where a
special prohibitory Act does not except the practising
physician from its operation, he is liable if he administers
intoxicating bitters to his patient, but not for using liquors
necessary in compounding medicine manufactured and sold
by him. The application of any other rule, it was said by
the Court, would be fraught with difficulty, if not im­prac­ti­ca­bil­ity.
So, too, in Kansas (<a id="fnanchor-408" href="#fn-408" class="fnanchor">408</a>).</p>

<p>Any registered practitioner who has been convicted of
felony shall forfeit his right to registration, and the Medical
Council may cause his name to be erased from the register;
and if any one who has been convicted of felony presents
himself for registration the registrar may refuse registration.
But one’s name cannot legally be removed from
the register without notice and an opportunity of being
heard (<a id="fnanchor-409" href="#fn-409" class="fnanchor">409</a>).</p>

<p>A person who has met with personal injuries must
exercise the same degree of care in the employment of a
physician and surgeon, and in procuring and submitting
to proper medical treatment, as a prudent and reasonable
man would in any other matter; for those persons liable
for the original injury will not be responsible for the further
damage arising from the improper selection of a physician (<a id="fnanchor-410" href="#fn-410" class="fnanchor">410</a>).</p>

<p>If a family doctor, or the surgeon of a company or
society, on leaving home, recommends in case of need,
some other physician, who is not, however, in any sense in
his employment, it does not make him in any way liable
for injuries arising from the latter’s want of skill (<a id="fnanchor-411" href="#fn-411" class="fnanchor">411</a>).</p>

CHAPTER XII.
<span class="smallerblk">DISSECTION AND RESURRECTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A knowledge of the causes and nature of sundry diseases
which affect the human body, and of the best methods of
treating and curing such diseases, and of healing and repairing
divers wounds and injuries to which the human
frame is liable, cannot be acquired without the aid of
anatomical examination. So saith the preamble to the
British Anatomy Act of 1832. The chief hindrances to the
pursuit of the study of anatomy have arisen from ignorance
and superstition. A prejudice has prevailed in all nations
against the violation of the human body after death. Even
now, only philosophers like Jeremy Bentham are willing to
have their bodies dissected by their friends. Simple association
of thoughts causes the remains of a dead kinsman
or friend to be treated with respect and tenderness; in the
same way, the horror of death attaching to anything connected
with the dead, and the religious idea that the soul
outlives the body, and continues in a ghostly way to retain
a connection with its old habitation of clay, have led to the
respectful disposal of the corpse among most nations.</p>

<p>The Ptolemy princes Philadelphus and Euergetes, who
enabled their physicians to dissect the human body, and
prevented the prejudices of ignorance and superstition from
compromising the welfare of the human race, were far in
advance of their times. Long after their day, the Koran
denounced as unclean the person who touched a corpse, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p150">|150|</span>
the rules of Islamism still forbid dissection; the old Moslem
doctors only found opportunities of studying the bones of
the human body in the cemeteries. Not until the days of
Henry VIII. did the law make any provision for the
cultivation and practice of the art of dissection. In 1540,
more perhaps to strike terror into malefactors, than from
any enlightened notion of forwarding knowledge, the Legislature
gave permission to the masters of the Mystery of
Barbers and Surgeons of London to take annually four
persons, put to death for felony, for anatomies, and to make
incision of the same dead bodies, or otherwise to order the
same, after their discretions, at their pleasure, for their
further insight and better knowledge, instruction, insight,
learning, and experience, in the science or faculty of
surgery (<a id="fnanchor-412" href="#fn-412" class="fnanchor">412</a>).</p>

<p>Elizabeth, in 1565, made a similar grant to the College of
Physicians, that they, observing all decent respect for
human flesh, “might dissect the four felons.” By 25 Geo. II.
cap. 37 (1752), the bodies of all murderers executed in London
and Westminster were to be given to the surgeons to
be dissected and anatomised. But the legal supply of
human bodies for anatomical examination still continued
insufficient fully to provide the means of knowledge; and
in order to furnish the necessary subjects, divers great and
grievous crimes and murders were committed, the money
paid, being the incentive. So, in 1832, the Anatomy Act (<a id="fnanchor-413" href="#fn-413" class="fnanchor">413</a>)
was passed. This Act proves clearly that Parliament
regarded anatomy as a legal practice, and it provides for
the licensing of those practising anatomy, allows any
executor or other person, having lawful possession of any
dead person (and not being an undertaker, etc.), to hand
over the body for dissection (respect, however, being had to
<span class="xxpn" id="p151">|151|</span>
the wishes of the deceased or his known relatives). Inspectorships
of schools of anatomy were likewise established.</p>

<p>In Canada, the bodies of convicts who die in a penitentiary,
if unclaimed by the relatives, may be delivered to the professors
of anatomy in any medical college, or to an inspector
of anatomy (<a id="fnanchor-414" href="#fn-414" class="fnanchor">414</a>).</p>

<p>The first defender of the faith, Henry VIII., the illustrious
Elizabeth of most famous memory, and the enlightened
James, had several statutes passed in which the disinterring
of the dead is mentioned, but they were chiefly enactments
against witchcraft, conjuration, the use of dead men’s
bones, and all sorts of sorceries. The parliament of James
solemnly enacted, “that if any person should consult,
covenant with, entertain, employ, feed or reward any evil
and wicked spirit, to or for any intent or purpose, or take
up any dead man, woman, or child out of his, her, or their
grave, or any other place where the dead body rested, or
the skin, bone, or any other part of any dead person, to be
employed, or used, in any manner of witchcraft, sorcery,
charm, or enchantment *&#160;* every such offender, his aiders,
abettors, and counsellors, should suffer death as felons, and
should lose the privilege and benefit of clergy and sanctuary” (<a id="fnanchor-415" href="#fn-415" class="fnanchor">415</a>).
This philosophical enactment graced the statute
book until the ninth year of George II. While these
statutes against sorcery were in force, and the Judges still
imbued with the superstitious spirit of the age, the presumption
was very strong that bodies disinterred were
removed for purposes of enchantment or witchcraft, and
resurrection-men and students of anatomy, as their aiders
and abettors, were in imminent jeopardy of suffering as
felons; but as the belief in sorcery grew weaker the prospect
of these men grew brighter, and they were relieved
from the great danger that they ran.
<span class="xxpn" id="p152">|152|</span></p>

<p>Under the laws of Constantine, a woman could without
blame repudiate her husband, if he was guilty of violating
the tombs of the dead; and we are told that the Ostrogoths
allowed divorce for this same reason. And among the
Franks, one who took the clothing from a buried corpse
was banished from society, and none could relieve his wants
until the relations of the deceased consented (<a id="fnanchor-416" href="#fn-416" class="fnanchor">416</a>). As long
ago as the tenth year of James I., at the assizes in Leicester,
a man was tried for stealing winding sheets. Sir Edward
Coke tells the matter thus: “One William Hain had in the
night digged up the graves of divers several men and of one
woman, and took the winding sheets from the bodies and
buried the bodies again; and I advising hereupon, for the
rareness of the case, consulted with the Judges at Sergeants’
Inn on Fleet street, when we all resolved, that the property
of the sheets was in the executors, administrators, or other
owner of them, for the dead body is not capable of any
property, and the property of the sheets must be in somebody,
and according to this resolution he was indicted of
felony in the next assizes; but the jury found it but petit
larceny, for which he was whipped, as he well deserved.”
These learned people thought that if a winding sheet had
been gratuitously furnished by a friend the property remained
in the donor. For, quoth they, the winding sheet
must be the property of somebody; a dead body, being but
a lump of earth, hath no capacity; also, it is no gift to the
person, but bestowed on the body for the reverence toward
it, to express the hope of the resurrection; also, a man cannot
relinquish the property he hath to his goods unless they be
vested in another (<a id="fnanchor-417" href="#fn-417" class="fnanchor">417</a>). Subsequently, lawyers have generally
concurred in these opinions; the coffin, too, is the property
of the personal representative of the deceased (<a id="fnanchor-418" href="#fn-418" class="fnanchor">418</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p153">|153|</span></p>

<p>A still more interesting question arises as to who owns
the corpse. It has been generally held that there is no
property in it. Blackstone remarks, that, although the heir
has a property in the monuments or escutcheons of his ancestor,
he has none in his body or ashes. According to the
law of England, after the death of a man, his executors have
a right to the possession and custody of his body (although
they have no property in it) until it is properly buried.
A man cannot dispose of his body by will or any other
instrument (<a id="fnanchor-419" href="#fn-419" class="fnanchor">419</a>). A contract for the sale of a corpse, even
to doctors, will not be enforced; it cannot be made an
article of merchandise (<a id="fnanchor-420" href="#fn-420" class="fnanchor">420</a>). The relatives have the right
of interring the body, and when this right is once exercised
they have no further interest in it than to protect it from
injury (<a id="fnanchor-421" href="#fn-421" class="fnanchor">421</a>). In Indiana, the Courts have diverged somewhat
from the beaten track, and held that the surviving relatives
are entitled to the corpse in the order of inheritance as
property, and that they have a right to dispose of it as such,
subject to whatever burial regulations are reasonable and
proper for the public health and advantage (<a id="fnanchor-422" href="#fn-422" class="fnanchor">422</a>).</p>

<p>The English Anatomy Act, as has been seen, gives the
executor or other person having the lawful possession of the
body of any deceased person power to permit it to be
anatomically examined. In England, the earlier writers on
criminal law say nothing of the taking of a body from the
grave, except that it is not theft. East, however, calls it a
great misdemeanor; and there have been several convictions
for this as an offence at Common Law. Doubtless the belief
that it was an offence at Common Law was nearly connected
<span class="xxpn" id="p154">|154|</span>
with the idea of the bodies being used for the dark purposes
of the necromancer, and it would appear that no distinct
authority upon the abstract point has been found in
ancient legal records (<a id="fnanchor-423" href="#fn-423" class="fnanchor">423</a>). It is still an indictable offence,
punishable with fine and imprisonment, or both (<a id="fnanchor-424" href="#fn-424" class="fnanchor">424</a>). And
this even though the body has been taken in the interest
of science, and for the purpose of dissection; or even if the
motives of the offender were pious and laudable. In <i>Lynn’s</i>
case—(Lynn was indicted for entering a burying ground,
taking a coffin up, and carrying away a corpse for the purposes
of dissection)—it was urged that the offence was cognizable
only by the ecclesiastical courts; but the Judges of the
King’s Bench said that common decency required that a
stop should be put to the practice; that it was an offence
cognizable in a criminal court as being highly indecent,
and <i>contra bonos mores</i>, at the bare idea alone of which
nature revolted; that the purpose of taking up the body for
dissection did not make it less an indictable offence. They
refused to stay proceedings, but inasmuch as Lynn might
have committed the deed merely through ignorance, they
only fined him five marks. Since then others have been
more severely dealt with. And in a very recent case,
Stephen, J., said, “The law to be collected from these
authorities seems to me to be this:—The practice of
anatomy is lawful, though it may involve an unusual
means of disposing of dead bodies, and though it certainly
shocks the feelings of many persons; but to open a grave
and disinter a dead body without authority is a misdemeanor,
even if it is done for a laudable purpose.”</p>

<p>It is, also, an indictable offence in many of the States to
disinter a corpse, unless the deceased in his life-time had
<span class="xxpn" id="p155">|155|</span>
directed such a thing, or his relatives consent to it; and
that the resurrecting is for the purpose of dissecting does
not improve matters (<a id="fnanchor-425" href="#fn-425" class="fnanchor">425</a>). In New York, removing dead
bodies “for the purpose of selling the same,” or “from
mere wantonness,” is punishable by both fine and imprisonment (<a id="fnanchor-426" href="#fn-426" class="fnanchor">426</a>).
And in New Hampshire and Vermont such
offences bring upon those convicted, fines, whipping, and
imprisonment, as the Court may see fit.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, unclaimed dead bodies, and those of
persons killed in duels, or capitally executed, are assigned
to the medical schools of the State. The New York Act of
1789 must be considered as the first American Anatomy
Law. The first section prohibits the removal of dead bodies
for dissection, and the second section permits the Courts, in
passing capital sentence, to award the body to the surgeons
for dissection. Enactments similar to that of the New
York Act, sec. 1, have been passed by the following
States: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri,
Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West
Virginia, and Wisconsin. The second section of the New
York Act has developed into the Acts of twenty-four States,
which have thus legalized dissection, and most of them
have made specific provision for the dissection of the bodies
of certain deceased criminals, chiefly murderers; these
States are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Some of these States
<span class="xxpn" id="p156">|156|</span>
have made no other provision for anatomical study beyond
that mentioned (<a id="fnanchor-427" href="#fn-427" class="fnanchor">427</a>). We have already referred to the Canadian
Act on this subject. In addition, the Ontario Act
provides that the bodies of persons found dead, publicly
exposed, or who at time of death had been supported
in and by some institution receiving government aid
(except lunatics in provincial asylums), shall, unless
the person so dying otherwise direct, or the <i>bona fide</i>
friends or relations claim it, be given to public medical
schools in the locality, or to public teachers of anatomy
or surgery, or private medical practitioners, having
three or more pupils, for whose instruction such
bodies are actually required. Such medical practitioners
must give security for the decent interment of the
bodies after they have served their purposes; and then a
written authority to open a dissecting room is given by the
Inspector of Anatomy of the city, town, or place. The Inspector’s
duty is to keep a register of bodies given up for
dissection; a register of the qualified practitioners desiring
bodies; to make an impartial distribution of the bodies in
rotation; to visit the dissection rooms, and to report to the
police magistrate or chief municipal officer, any improper
conduct on the part of students or teachers (<a id="fnanchor-428" href="#fn-428" class="fnanchor">428</a>).</p>

<p>A person may be found guilty of the offence of disinterring
a corpse, even though he was not actually present at
the body-lifting, if with the intention of giving aid and
assistance he was near enough to afford it, if required (<a id="fnanchor-429" href="#fn-429" class="fnanchor">429</a>).</p>

<p>Besides the danger he runs of being brought before a
criminal tribunal, the body-lifter incurs the risk of civil
proceedings being taken against him. It is true, as Blackstone
says, the heir has no property in the body or ashes of
<span class="xxpn" id="p157">|157|</span>
his ancestors; nor can he bring any civil action against
such as indecently, at least, if not impiously, violate and
disturb their remains when dead and buried; but that
learned commentator goes on to remark: “The person,
indeed, who has the freehold of the soil, may bring an
action of trespass against such as dig and disturb it” (<a id="fnanchor-430" href="#fn-430" class="fnanchor">430</a>).
This has been clearly established in a case in Massachusetts,
where a father sued for the removal of the
remains of his child, and recovered a verdict for $837 in
an action of trespass <i>quare clausum fregit</i>. Mr. Justice
Forster, in giving judgment, remarks that a dead body is not
the subject of property, and after burial it becomes part of
the ground to which it has been committed, earth to earth,
dust to dust, ashes to ashes. The only action that can be
brought is trespass <i>quare clausum</i>. Any one, said the Judge,
in actual possession of the land may maintain this against
a wrong-doer. The gist of the action is the breaking and
entering, but the circumstances which accompany and give
character to the trespass may always be shown either in
aggravation or mitigation. Acts of gross carelessness as
well as those of wilful mischief often inflict a serious wound
to the feelings, when the injury done to property is comparatively
trifling, and we know of no rule of law which
requires the mental suffering of the party complaining,
caused by the misconduct of the wrong-doer, to be disregarded (<a id="fnanchor-431" href="#fn-431" class="fnanchor">431</a>).</p>

<p>Willcock, in his “Laws relating to the Medical Profession,”
in his tenth chapter, when considering the lawfulness or
unlawfulness of taking bodies for the purpose of dissection,
says: “The whole question must depend upon the proper
answer to these inquiries. Is it a violation of property?
<span class="xxpn" id="p158">|158|</span>
Is it a personal injury to any individual? Or is it an injury
to the public? Every lawyer who has mentioned the subject
has admitted that there is no violation of property in
respect of the corpse itself, which is necessary to constitute
the removal an offence; and Blackstone has distinctly stated
that the only property violated is the grass and soil of the
land wherein the body was interred, in respect of which the
person may bring his action of trespass, and the law has
not provided any punishment as for an offence. It is equally
clear that it is not an injury to any person; for the shrewd
lawyers of Coke’s time determined that the body was no
person but a lump of clay; and the only injury which can
give a right of action to—that is which amounts to a violation
of any legal right of—a relative or master, is such as may be
said to recoil upon him, by causing him expense, labor, or
loss of valuable service. The unpleasantness which may
arise from an attack upon prejudices, however intimately
blended with good feeling and delicacy of sentiment, is
ranked by the court with that class of wrongs which are
technically designated <i>damna absque injuria</i>.”</p>

<p>“In <i>Lynn’s</i> case, the judges assumed to answer the third
question, that is to assert that it is an injury to the public.
Society is not injured by the disinterment of the dead for
the purposes of science, for it could hardly exist without
such a sacrifice of fastidiousness; society is not insulted by
the secret abstraction of the corpse from the vermin which
crowd to pollute it, and they who so curiously seek the
remains of those they hold dear, behind the veil of science,
would do well to pry for one moment into the secrets of the
sepulchre. They alone are the violators of every sentiment
of delicacy and benevolence who insult the disconsolate
relatives with the tale of the robbery and the pursuit, and
with the foul spectacle of dismemberment they may have
at length discovered.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p159">|159|</span></p>

<p>It would appear that in a proper case the Court, in the
interests of justice, will compel the exhuming and examination
of a dead body which is under the control of a
plaintiff, if there is strong reason to believe that without
such examination a fraud is likely to be accomplished, and
the defendant has exhausted every other method known to
the law of exposing it. However, such an order should be
made only upon a strong showing to that effect. “It would
be a proceeding repugnant to the best feelings of our nature,
and likely to be in many cases so abhorrent to the sensibilities
of the surviving relatives, that they would prefer an
abandonment of the suit to a compliance with the order.”
Thus spake the court in a case where the order for exhuming
was asked for and refused as not being justified under
the circumstances. The action was on a policy of insurance,
and the defence was, that the insured had falsely
warranted that he had never received any serious personal
injury, whereas his skull had been fractured in boyhood,
and had been healed by trephining. To prove this, the
company proposed to disinter his body, after the suit had
been pending eighteen months, upon the sole testimony of
his physician, that the deceased had said that he had been
told of such an accident and operation. The counsel for the
plaintiff called the proposal “revolting,” and said that to
break the signet of the grave, and take from its resting
place the sacred property of relatives to gratify the corporation’s
mercenary curiosity, would be worse than Shylock’s
demand (<a id="fnanchor-432" href="#fn-432" class="fnanchor">432</a>).</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="p160"
title="Chapter XIII. Dentists.">CHAPTER XIII.
<span class="smallerblk">DENTISTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The need of dentists existed long before dentistry. The
Preacher knew of the inconveniences which arise when the
grinders are few. Marcellus, about B. C. 380, gave two
receipts for toothache. One is, “Say, ‘argidam, margidam,
sturgidam;’” the other is, “Spit in a frog’s mouth and
request him to make off with the complaint.” These are
given in Glenn’s “Laws affecting Medical Men.”</p>

<p>In England, in the tenth and eleventh centuries, priests
and monks were the dentists of the day. Afterwards, a
decree of the Council of Tours having forbad clergymen
undertaking or engaging in any bloody operation, all surgical
practice fell into the hands of blacksmiths and barbers.
The latter soon became the more important class, and in
1461 (as we have seen already), Edward IV. incorporated
them as “The Freeman of the Mystery or Faculty of Surgery.”
By degrees other persons assumed to practise pure
surgery, and these two bodies, in 1560, were united by Act
of Parliament, and became “The Masters or Governors of
the Mystery and Commonalty of the Barbers and Surgeons
of London.” By the third section of this Act (<a id="fnanchor-433" href="#fn-433" class="fnanchor">433</a>), because of
fear of the spread of contagious diseases, any one in the
City of London using barbery or shaving, was forbidden to
<span class="xxpn" id="p161">|161|</span>
occupy any surgery, letting of blood, or any other thing
belonging to surgery, drawing of teeth only excepted. In
those days one wishing to find a drawer of teeth had to
resort to one of those shops where was exhibited the bandaged
pole as a sign or symbol that “all the King’s liege
people there passing by might know at all times whither to
resort in time of necessity.”</p>

<p>Something more than a sign is now required of dental
surgeons. The Royal College of Surgeons in England has
now the power to appoint examiners for testing the fitness
of persons to practise as dentists, and to grant certificates
of such fitness. To become a Licentiate of Dental Surgery
in England, it is necessary to be engaged for four years in
the acquirement of professional knowledge; to attend at
a recognized school one course of lectures, at least, in
anatomy, physiology, surgery, medicine, chemistry, and
materia medica, and a second course on the anatomy of the
head and neck; one course on metallurgy, and two on
dental surgery and anatomy, dental physiology and mechanics;
to have dissected for nine months; to have taken
a course of chemical manipulation; to have attended a
hospital for two or more sessions; and to have spent three
years in acquiring practical familiarity in mechanical dentistry
under a competent practitioner; and then to pass the
examination required by the board.</p>

<p>In Ontario, “The Royal College of Dental Surgeons” has
power to appoint a Board of Directors, who have authority
to fix the curriculum of studies to be pursued by students,
to determine the period during which they must be employed
under a practitioner, to appoint the examiners, and arrange
the examinations, for those who desire to obtain a license
to practise dental surgery in the province. The Board may
also confer the title of “Master of Dental Surgery” upon
any licentiate who passes certain examinations and
<span class="xxpn" id="p162">|162|</span>
conforms with certain regulations. The College is composed
of all those entitled to practise in the Province; and no one
who is not a member of the College can practise dentistry
for hire, gain or hope of reward, or pretend to hold, or take,
or use any name, title, addition or description, implying
that he holds a license to practise, or that he is a member
of the College, or shall falsely represent, or use any title
representing that he is a graduate of any dental college,
under a penalty of $20 and costs for every offence, to be
recovered in a summary way before a magistrate, or in a
Division Court by suit. Persons contravening the Act cannot
recover for work done or materials provided. Of course,
the Act does not interfere with legally qualified medical
practitioners (<a id="fnanchor-434" href="#fn-434" class="fnanchor">434</a>).</p>

<p>Dentists are subject to the same rules, as to negligence,
as are physicians or surgeons (<a id="fnanchor-435" href="#fn-435" class="fnanchor">435</a>), and if by a culpable want
of attention and care, or by the absence of a competent
degree of skill and knowledge, a D.D.S. causes injury to a
patient, he is liable to a civil action for damages, unless,
indeed, such injury be the immediate result of intervening
negligence on the part of the patient himself, or unless
such patient has by his own carelessness directly conduced
to the injury (<a id="fnanchor-436" href="#fn-436" class="fnanchor">436</a>). The law is ever reasonable; so it only
requires of a dentist a reasonable degree of care and skill
in his professional operations, and will not hold him
answerable for injuries arising from his want of the highest
attainments in his profession. The rule is, that the least
amount of skill with which a fair proportion of the practitioners
of a given locality are endowed, is the criterion by
which to judge of the professional man’s ability or skill (<a id="fnanchor-437" href="#fn-437" class="fnanchor">437</a>).
As far as the liability is concerned, no distinction is made
<span class="xxpn" id="p163">|163|</span>
between those who are regular practitioners and those who
are not so; the latter are equally bound with the former
to have and to employ competent skill and attention.</p>

<p>A patient must exercise ordinary care and prudence (<a id="fnanchor-438" href="#fn-438" class="fnanchor">438</a>);
so that, if one tells the dentist to pull out a tooth, but
does not say which one is to go, and the wrong one is taken
out, the sufferer has no legal ground of complaint, unless,
indeed, it is quite apparent which is the offending member.
A patient may have been a little careless and negligent;
still, if the dentist has been so very neglectful of his duty
that no ordinary care on the part of the patient would have
prevented the mistake or injury complained of, the injured
party will recover, <i>i.e.</i>, recover damages for the injury received (<a id="fnanchor-439" href="#fn-439" class="fnanchor">439</a>).</p>

<p>The fact that one has taken chloroform will not affect his
rights or remedies against the tooth-puller for any mistake
or negligence. The maxim <i>vigilantibus, non somnientibus jura
subveniunt</i>, has no reference to people put to sleep by
anæsthetics. In New York, two dentists undertook to
extract a tooth from a patient while the latter was under
the influence of laughing gas. During the operation the
forceps slipped, and part of the tooth went down the patient’s
throat, causing coughing and vomiting for four weeks,
when—in a fit of coughing—the tooth came up, and relief
followed. The patient sued for damages, and when the
case came before it, the Court said, “The defendants (the
dentists) knew that the plaintiff (the patient) while under
the influence of the anæsthetic, had no control of his
faculties, that they were powerless to act, and that he was
unable to exert the slightest effort to protect himself from
any of the probable or possible consequences of the operation
which they had undertaken to perform. He was in their
<span class="xxpn" id="p164">|164|</span>
charge and under their control to such an extent that they
were required to exercise the highest professional skill and
diligence to avoid every possible danger; for the law imposes
duties upon men according to the circumstances in which
they are called to act. In this case, skill and diligence must
be considered as indissolubly associated. The professional
man, no matter how skilful, who leaves an essential link
wanting, or a danger unguarded in the continuous chain
of treatment, is guilty of negligence, and if the omission
results in injury to the patient, the practitioner is answerable.
The quantum of evidence necessary to make out a
<i>primâ facie</i> case of negligence is very slight in some cases,
while in others a more strict proof is required. Often the
injury itself affords sufficient <i>primâ facie</i> evidence of negligence.
*&#160;*&#160;* There was evidence offered by the
plaintiff showing, that while the defendant drew the tooth,
the forceps slipped. This fact, combined with the unusual
circumstance that the tooth went down instead of coming
up, was sufficient to carry the case to the jury upon the
question of negligence. The trial Judge held that while the
affirmative was upon the plaintiff to prove negligence, the
fact that the defendants, instead of taking the plaintiff’s
tooth out, let it go down his throat, was sufficient evidence
to carry the question of negligence to the jury, to the end
that they might determine whether, in the light of all the
circumstances, the defendants had exercised the skill and
care which the exigencies of the case required. This ruling
was correct” (<a id="fnanchor-440" href="#fn-440" class="fnanchor">440</a>).</p>

<p>Boyle’s case is an interesting one on the subject of the
use of chloroform. He was a street-car driver; a vicious
horse by a kick threw him from his platform, so that he hit
his head against a tree-box. He was picked up insensible
and carried into a surgery; this he was enabled to leave
<span class="xxpn" id="p165">|165|</span>
in a couple of hours, and the following day went to work
again. In course of time he had a toothache, and went to
a Dr. Winslow’s to have it extracted, intending to take
chloroform. The chloroform was administered, but did
not operate as soon as usual, exciting rather than tranquilizing
B. Insensibility, however, having been finally
obtained, the teeth were taken out, the doctor giving the
anæsthetic from time to time during the operation, as
symptoms of returning consciousness appeared. Boyle
walked home shortly afterwards, feeling, however, dizzy,
and being uncertain in his gait; these unpleasant symptoms
continued even after reaching his house. The next
day, thickness of speech and numbness of one arm and side
came on, with partial paralysis. From this he was still
suffering, when a jury was called upon to say whether his
state was due to the neglect of the dentist or not. The
Judge told the jury that, even if they doubted the safety of
the agent employed (chloroform), there was still a consideration
of the highest reason which they ought not to
disregard. He remarked, “All science is the result of a
voyage of exploration, and the science of medicine can
hardly be said to have yet reached the shore. Men must
be guided therefore by what is probably true, and are not
responsible for their ignorance of the absolute truth which
is not known. If a medical practitioner resorts to the
acknowledged proper sources of information—if he sits at
the feet of masters of high reputation and does as they
have taught him—he has done his duty, and should not be
made answerable for the evils that may result from
errors in the instruction which he has received. *&#160;*&#160;*
He who acts according to the best known authority is a
skilful practitioner, although that authority should lead
him in some respects wrong. *&#160;*&#160;* If the plaintiff
was from previous circumstances predisposed to paralysis,
it might well happen that the extraction of his teeth,
<span class="xxpn" id="p166">|166|</span>
without the chloroform, or the use of the chloroform
without the extraction, would bring on a paralytic attack.
Even if this was the case, still it would not be just to make
the defendant answerable for consequences which he could
not foresee, which were not the ordinary or probable result
of what he did. He was only bound to look to what was
natural and probable, to what might reasonably be anticipated.
Unless such guard is thrown around the physician
his judgment may be clouded, or his confidence shaken by
the dread of responsibility, at those critical moments when
it is all important that he should retain the free and
undisturbed enjoyment of his faculties, in order to use
them for the benefit of the patient” (<a id="fnanchor-441" href="#fn-441" class="fnanchor">441</a>).</p>

<p>In the olden time, front teeth were considered very
valuable. Our ancestors appear to have used them in
fighting, and the hurting of a man so as to render him
less able in fighting to defend himself or annoy his adversary,
was considered a misdemeanor of the highest kind,
and spoken of by my Lord Coke as the greatest offence
under felony. To cut off an ear or strike off a nose was
nothing to the knocking out of a fore-tooth, for a nose or
an ear is useless in a fight—doubtless they are in the
way (<a id="fnanchor-442" href="#fn-442" class="fnanchor">442</a>). According to that system of punishment introduced
into England by the Engles, which compensated
every injury by a money payment, a front tooth was
valued highly, and one who deprived another of such a
member had to pay six shillings, while breaking a rib only
cost half as much, and shattering a thigh only twelve
shillings (<a id="fnanchor-443" href="#fn-443" class="fnanchor">443</a>).</p>

<p>The fact that a dentist extracts teeth for love and not for
money does not relieve him of his liability for failure to
perform his work properly (<a id="fnanchor-444" href="#fn-444" class="fnanchor">444</a>); and if one is foolish enough
<span class="xxpn" id="p167">|167|</span>
to allow an ignorant apprentice to practise on his teeth,
he can still recover from the dentist for any injuries (<a id="fnanchor-445" href="#fn-445" class="fnanchor">445</a>).
It is a good answer to an action brought by a dentist to
recover payment for his work and labor, that the defendant
has been injured instead of benefited by the plaintiff’s treatment,
either because of his want of skill or his negligence.
So, when Mr. Gilpin went to Mr. Wainwright to have a
tooth extracted, and Wainwright gave him chloroform,
and then pulled out the wrong tooth, and Gilpin declined
to pay for the performance, alleging a want of consideration,
the dentist sued for his account, but the Court gave judgment
against him (<a id="fnanchor-446" href="#fn-446" class="fnanchor">446</a>). If the dentist’s bill has been increased
owing to his own mistake or wrong doing—as where
being employed to pull out one tooth and insert a false one,
he pulled out two, and so had to put in two; he cannot
recover for this additional amount of work. Lord Kenyon
well put this when he said: “If a man is sent for to extract
a thorn which might be pulled out with a pair of nippers,
and through his misconduct it becomes necessary to amputate
the limb, shall it be said, that he may come into a court
of justice to recover fee for the cure of the wound which he
himself has caused?” (<a id="fnanchor-447" href="#fn-447" class="fnanchor">447</a>). To put the question is to give
the answer. In fact, in such a case as the one put, it would
appear that not only could no recovery be had for the
additional services rendered necessary by the dentist’s own
want of proper care, but the man whose grinders were thus
made few would be entitled to a further deduction from the
bill for the bodily suffering and damage he had sustained (<a id="fnanchor-448" href="#fn-448" class="fnanchor">448</a>).</p>

<p>One cannot reasonably expect to have teeth as well fitted
to the mouth by art as nature. Mrs. Henry got a
set of artificial ones from Dr. Simonds; when put into her
<span class="xxpn" id="p168">|168|</span>
mouth, she complained that they felt odd and pained her.
The plate was somewhat filed, but she was still dissatisfied,
and declined to pay the bill. It was then agreed that she
should take them away and try them for a day or two;
this was done, and again she returned them, declining to
pay. The doctor then sued, and the evidence as to whether
the teeth fitted was conflicting. One testified that they
were a good piece of work; another, that they were a fair
average piece of work; while a third said that they were
nothing extra. The Judge instructed the jury that if
Simonds had used all the knowledge and skill to which the
art had at the time advanced, that would be all that could
be required of him. The verdict was for the defendant.
On an application for a new trial the court considered the
instructions erroneous and granted a new trial, saying:
“that surgeons are held responsible for injuries resulting
from a want of ordinary care and skill. The highest
degree of skill is not to be expected, nor can it reasonably
be required, of all. The instruction given was *&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*
undoubtedly correct, and no more would be required of
him. But, upon legal principles, could so much be required
of him? We think not. If it could, then every professional
man would be bound to possess the highest
attainment, and to exercise the greatest skill in his profession.
Such a requirement would be unreasonable” (<a id="fnanchor-449" href="#fn-449" class="fnanchor">449</a>).</p>

<p>It is a dangerous thing for both parties for the dentist to
try a new instrument or a new <i>modus operandi</i> for the first
time—doing so the Court once said was a rash act, and he
who acts rashly acts ignorantly. Using a new instrument
is acting contrary to the known rule and usage of the profession (<a id="fnanchor-450" href="#fn-450" class="fnanchor">450</a>).
One cannot become an experimentalist except
at his own peril.
<span class="xxpn" id="p169">|169|</span></p>

<p>A dentist, at a lady’s request, prepared a model of her mouth,
and made two sets of artificial teeth for her. In response
to a letter notifying her that they were ready, and asking
when he could come and put them in, the dentist received
the following note: “My dear Sir, I regret, after your kind
effort to oblige me, my health will prevent my taking advantage
of the early day. I fear I may not be able for some
days. Yours, etc., Frances P.” Very shortly the lady
died. The dentist sued her executors for £21, but he failed
to recover. The court held that a contract to make a set
of teeth is a contract for the sale of goods, wares or merchandise
within the meaning of the seventeenth section of
the Statute of Frauds; and that as by the terms of the contract
the teeth were to be fitted to the lady’s mouth, and as
this, through no default on her part, was never done, her
executors were not liable to the dentist for work done and
materials provided; nor was the letter a sufficient memorandum
within the meaning of the Act referred to. Counsel
for the plaintiff and the Court seemed to differ widely in
their opinions of the artistic nature of tooth-making. The
former, arguing that the deceased had in truth contracted
for the skill of the dentist, and that the materials were
merely auxiliary to the work and labour, said this case was
not to be distinguished from that of an artist employed to
paint a picture; the ivory used was of insignificant value
as compared to the skill employed. Judge Crompton, however,
said: “Here the subject matter of the contract was
the supply of goods. The case bears a strong resemblance
to that of a tailor supplying a coat, the measurement of the
mouth and the fitting of the teeth being analogous to the
measurement and fitting of the garment” (<a id="fnanchor-451" href="#fn-451" class="fnanchor">451</a>).</p>

<p>A similar view of the standing of a dentist was taken by
the Court in Michigan, when it held that he was a “mechanic.”
The Court observed, “A dentist, in one sense, is
<span class="xxpn" id="p170">|170|</span>
a professional man, but, in another sense, his calling is mainly
mechanical, and the tools which he employs are used in
mechanical operations. Indeed, dentistry was formerly
purely mechanical, and instruction in it scarcely went
beyond manual dexterity in the use of tools; and a knowledge
of the human system generally, and of the diseases
which might affect the teeth and render an operation important,
was by no means considered necessary. Of late,
however, as the physiology of the human system has become
better understood, and the relations of the various parts
and their mutual dependence become more clearly recognized,
dentistry has made great progress as a science, and
its practitioners claim, with much justice, to be classed
among the learned professions. It is nevertheless true
that the operations of the dentist are, for the most part,
mechanical, and so far as tools are employed, they are
purely so, and we could not exclude these tools from the
exemption which the statute makes, without confining the
construction of the statute within limits not justified by the
words employed” (<a id="fnanchor-452" href="#fn-452" class="fnanchor">452</a>). On the other hand, in Mississippi, the
Court said, “A dentist cannot be properly denominated a
‘mechanic.’ It is true that the practice of his art requires
the use of instruments for manual operations, and that
much of it consists in manual operations; but it also involves
a knowledge of the physiology of the teeth, which
cannot be acquired but by a proper course of study, and
this is taught by learned treatises upon the subject, and as a
distinct though limited part of the medical art, in institutions
established for the purpose. It requires both science
and skill, and if such persons should be included in the
denomination of ‘mechanics,’ because their pursuit required
the use of mechanical instruments and skill in
manual operation, the same reason would include general
surgeons under the same denomination, because the
<span class="xxpn" id="p171">|171|</span>
practice of their profession depends in a great degree upon
similar instruments and operative skill; nor could such a
pursuit properly be said to be a trade” (<a id="fnanchor-453" href="#fn-453" class="fnanchor">453</a>).</p>

<p>False teeth have been considered necessaries for a wife.
One Andrews had a conversation with Gilman, a dentist,
as to the latter furnishing the former’s wife with a plate of
mineral teeth, and he agreed to pay for certain other dental
services rendered to Mrs. A. The plate was furnished while
Mr. and Mrs. A. were living together, and it was quite
suitable to the former’s circumstances and station in life;
he saw it, knew whence it came, raised no objection to it,
still he declined to pay for it. The Court, however, held him
liable, not only because the wife being permitted to retain
the plate, and the other circumstances, showed her authority
to make the purchase, but also on the ground that the teeth
were some of those necessaries wherewith a husband is
bound to furnish his wife (<a id="fnanchor-454" href="#fn-454" class="fnanchor">454</a>).</p>

<p>A dentist must not take any unfair advantage of his
patient. Some thirty years ago, one Captain Simpson, a
very old seaman and a pensioner in Greenwich Hospital,
gave a bill of exchange, payable eight months after date,
for £262 10s. to one Davis, a London dentist, purporting to
be for value received. Davis said, the real bargain was
that he should during the whole of the Captain’s life attend
to his teeth, and supply him with new ones from time to
time. He also said that a new set of teeth would cost from
£30 to £50. The bill was in the handwriting of D.; it was
given in his house when no third person was by, and it was
never heard of until after the captain’s death, which took
place before it was due. There was no writing as to the
teeth. The executors of Simpson declined to pay, whereupon
Davis handed the note over to a creditor of his own,
<span class="xxpn" id="p172">|172|</span>
who sued both parties.  The executors filed a bill in
chancery, impeaching the document for fraud, and asking
that it might be delivered up to them. The Court thought
that it was quite impossible for any reasonable being to
draw any inference from the materials before it, but that
it was a case of fraud—nay, a gross fraud, and the decree
was made as asked (<a id="fnanchor-455" href="#fn-455" class="fnanchor">455</a>). Sir Launcelot Shadwell thought
that the case had points of resemblance to that of <i>Dent</i>
v. <i>Bennett</i> (<a id="fnanchor-456" href="#fn-456" class="fnanchor">456</a>), in which a medical man bargained for a very
large sum of money to attend a person of advanced years
until death; but in that case the doctor had to attend to
the whole human body, not merely to a particular part of it.</p>

<p>One dentist must not imitate too closely the sign or card
of a fellow practitioner. One Colton alleged that he had
purchased from a Dr. G. Q. Colton the right to use the
name “Colton Dental Association” in connection with the
use of nitrous-oxide gas to alleviate pain in the extraction
of teeth, and that he used the same in advertisements and
prominently displayed it on signs; that the defendant,
who had been in his employment, left him, opened dental
rooms in the same street, issued cards announcing that he
was “formerly operator at the Colton Dental Rooms,” and
extracted teeth without pain by the use of nitrous-oxide gas,
and put a sign to the same purport over his door, but the
words “formerly operator at the,” upon cards and sign,
were in small and almost illegible letters, while the words
“Colton Dental Rooms” were very conspicuous; the signs
were very similar in shape, size, &amp;c., and were hung on the
same side of the street, in the same manner, and might
readily be mistaken the one for the other, especially by
suffering patients impatient for relief. An injunction
against the defendant’s cards and signs was granted (<a id="fnanchor-457" href="#fn-457" class="fnanchor">457</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p173">|173|</span></p>

<p>And where Morgan and Schuyler, two dentists, dissolved
partnership, S. bought M.’s interest in the fixtures and in
the lease of the room, and continued business therein. M.
removed his name from the sign, but S. replaced it, and
put above, in letters so small as to be nearly imperceptible,
his own name with the words “successor to.” The agreement
of dissolution did not prohibit M. from engaging in
the business, so he opened an office therefor in another
part of the city. He then applied to the Court to restrain
his late partner from the use of his name as mentioned.
He was successful in his action. But the Court thought
that S. would have kept within his rights if he had merely
described himself as “late of” the firm (<a id="fnanchor-458" href="#fn-458" class="fnanchor">458</a>).</p>

<span class="smallerblk">DRUGGISTS.</span></h2></div>

<p>A druggist, the Supreme Court of Louisiana says, means
“one who sells drugs without compounding or preparing
them: and so is a more limited term than apothecary
(<a id="fnanchor-459" href="#fn-459" class="fnanchor">459</a>).”</p>

<p>A commission merchant, dealing principally in alcohol,
is not a druggist, within the meaning of the Massachusetts’
Act, regulating the sale of alcohol by druggists
(<a id="fnanchor-460" href="#fn-460" class="fnanchor">460</a>); and
although whiskey may be sold by druggists in comparatively
small quantities as medicine, and doubtless a great many
people so take it, still it was held that fifty barrels of
whiskey remaining in a bonded warehouse at the time of
his death would not pass under the will of a wholesale and
retail drug­gist be­queath­ing his stock of medical drugs, etc.
The Court considered fifty barrels of whiskey wholly dis­pro­por­tion­ate
to the ordinary stock of medicine and drugs
kept on hand by the testator—too much sack for the
bread (<a id="fnanchor-461" href="#fn-461" class="fnanchor">461</a>).
One may be an apothecary or druggist although
he does not actually compound his medicines
(<a id="fnanchor-462" href="#fn-462" class="fnanchor">462</a>).</p>

<p>In the early days in England, the grocers, or poticaries,
who formed one of the trade guilds of London, united with
their ordinary business the sale of such ointments, simples
<span class="xxpn" id="p175">|175|</span>
and medicinal compounds as were then in use. In the days
of Henry VIII., the medical department of the grocers’ trade
being greatly increased, shops were established for the exclusive
sale of drugs and medicinal and all kinds of chemical
preparations. We have a graphic description of one of
these apothecaries about the days of “Good Queen Bess,”
in the words of the prince of English dramatists:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="stanza">

 <span class="smcap">J<span>ULIET,</span></span>
 Act. V., <span class="smmaj">SC.</span> 1.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Until 1868, any person whatever might open what is
called a chemist’s shop in England, and deal in drugs and
poisons. In that year, however, the Pharmacy Act was
passed, which prohibits any person engaging in the business
of, or assuming the title of, Chemist and Druggist, or dispensing
chemicals or drugs, unless he be registered under
that Act. And to be registered one must pass an examination
in Latin, English, arithmetic, prescriptions, practical
dispensing, pharmacy, materia medica, botany and chemistry.</p>

<p>Under the Ontario Act (<a id="fnanchor-463" href="#fn-463" class="fnanchor">463</a>) there is a College of Pharmacy,
managed by a Pharmaceutical Council who grant certificates
of competency to practise as pharmaceutical chemists,
prescribe the subjects on which candidates are to be
<span class="xxpn" id="p176">|176|</span>
examined, and arrange for the registration of chemists. No
one, save those registered or their employeés, is authorized
to compound prescriptions of legally authorized medical
practitioners. The Act, however, does not apply to medical
practitioners. But, save as aforesaid, no one can retail,
dispense, or compound poisons, or sell certain articles
named, or assume or use the title of “Chemist and Druggist,”
or “Chemist,” or “Druggist,” or “Pharmacist or
Apothecary,” or “Dispensing Chemist or Druggist,” unless
he has complied with the Act.</p>

<p>The Code Napoleon recognizes two classes of vendors of
drugs and medicines, apothecaries and druggists. The
former, who are assumed to be phar­ma­ceut­i­cally educated,
are alone allowed to sell compounded medicine, the latter
who are classed with grocers are only permitted to sell
drugs of a simple character in bulk and at wholesale (<a id="fnanchor-464" href="#fn-464" class="fnanchor">464</a>).
In the United States, wherever statutes do not otherwise
direct, apothecaries and druggists are put upon the common
law footing of provision vendors, and may sell in any
quantities articles in which they deal.</p>

<p>A druggist is held to a strict accountability in law for any
mistake he may make in compounding medicine or selling
his drugs. By the statute law of England it is declared to
be the duty of every person using or exercising the art or
mystery of an apothecary to prepare with exactness, and to
dispense, such medicines as may be directed for the sick by
any physician (<a id="fnanchor-465" href="#fn-465" class="fnanchor">465</a>). And by the same Act, for the further protection,
security, and benefit of George the Third’s subjects
it was declared, that if any one using the art or mystery of
an apothecary, should deliberately or negligently, unfaithfully,
fraudulently or unduly make, mix, prepare or sell any
medicines, as directed by any prescription signed by any
<span class="xxpn" id="p177">|177|</span>
licensed physician, such apothecary shall, on conviction
before a Justice of the Peace, unless good cause be shown to
the contrary, forfeit for the first offence £5, for second, £10,
and for third he shall forfeit his certificate. But apart from
any statute, whenever a druggist or apothecary (using the
words in their general sense) sells a medicine, he impliedly
warrants the good quality of the drugs sold; and besides
that, he warrants that it is the article that is required and
that it is compounded in every prescription dispensed by
him <i>secundum artem</i>. Like the provision dealer, the pharmaceutist
is bound to know that the goods he sells are
sound, <i>i.e.</i>, competent to perform the mission required of
them, and being so presumed to know, he warrants their
good qualities by the very act of selling them for such.
The rule, “Let the buyer beware,” does not apply.</p>

<p>In some way Fleet and Simple got cantharides mixed with
some snake root and Peruvian bark. Unfortunately
Hollenbeck, requiring some of this latter mixture, bought
this that these druggists had, took it as a medicine, and in
consequence suffered great pain, and had his health permanently
impaired. He sued for damages, and recovered
a verdict for $1,140. The defendants asked for a new trial,
but the Court refused it saying, “Purchasers have to trust
to a druggist. It is upon his skill and prudence they must
rely. It is his duty to know the properties of his drugs, to
be able to distinguish them from one another. It is his
duty so to qualify himself, or to employ those who are so
qualified, to attend to the business of compounding and
vending medicines and drugs, as that one drug may not be
sold for another; and so that, when a prescription is presented
to be made up the proper medicine, and none other,
be used in mixing and compounding it. The legal maxim
should be reversed, instead of <i>caveat emptor</i> it should be
<i>caveat venditor</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, let him be certain that
he does not sell
<span class="xxpn" id="p178">|178|</span>
to a purchaser or send to a patient, one thing for another,
as arsenic for calomel, cantharides for, or mixed with snake
root and Peruvian bark, or even one innocent drug calculated
to produce a certain effect, in place of another sent for
and designed to produce a different effect. If he does these
things he cannot escape civil responsibility upon the alleged
pretext that it was an accidental or an innocent mistake.
We are asked by the defendants’ attorneys in their argument,
with some emphasis, if druggists are in legal estimation,
to be regarded as insurers. The answer is, we see no
good reason why a vendor of drugs, should in his business
be entitled to a relaxation of the rule which applies to vendors
of provisions, which is, that the vendor undertakes and
insures that the article is wholesome (<a id="fnanchor-466" href="#fn-466" class="fnanchor">466</a>).”</p>

<p>The general customer is not supposed to be skilled in the
matter of drugs, but in the purchase he must rely upon the
druggist to furnish the article called for; and in this particular
business the customer who has not the experience
and learning necessary to a proper vending of drugs, will
not be held to the rule that he must examine for himself,
it would be but idle mockery for the customer to make the
examination when it would avail him nothing. On the
contrary, the business is such that in the very nature of
things, the druggist must be held to warrant that he will
deliver the drug called for and purchased by the customer (<a id="fnanchor-467" href="#fn-467" class="fnanchor">467</a>).</p>

<p>It is the duty of the druggist to know whether his drugs
are sound or not, and it is no answer to his want of knowledge
to say, that the buyer had opportunities for inspection,
and could judge for himself of the quality of goods (<a id="fnanchor-468" href="#fn-468" class="fnanchor">468</a>).</p>

<p>If a druggist miscompounds a medicine, or intentionally
deviates from the formula, he commits a tortious act, and
<span class="xxpn" id="p179">|179|</span>
if any injury arises to another through his ignorance or
neglect he is liable. Even if a physician writes a prescription
wrongly it is expected that the druggist will know
enough to detect the error, and whether he does so or not
he still compounds it at his peril. For one man’s negligence
or omission of duty is no palliation of another’s, and under
the doctrine of joint liability the apothecary or druggist
who compounds, knowingly or not, a noxious prescription,
commits a joint tort with the physician who writes
it (<a id="fnanchor-469" href="#fn-469" class="fnanchor">469</a>). And in an action against a druggist for injury
through the negligence of his clerk in selling sulphate of
zinc for Epsom salts, it is no defence to say that the
subsequent medical treatment was negligent (<a id="fnanchor-470" href="#fn-470" class="fnanchor">470</a>).</p>

<p>A wholesale druggist is liable in the same way as a retail,
when he supplies substances notoriously dangerous to health
or life, and he impliedly warrants the articles to be as
represented by their conventional designation, and if they
are not so, he is liable for all damages that may ensue from
his mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion (<a id="fnanchor-471" href="#fn-471" class="fnanchor">471</a>).</p>

<p>If a druggist affixes to a medicine, or drug, a label bearing
his name and stating it to have been prepared by him,
he makes the warrant only more notorious, and by so doing
(inasmuch as it is an invitation to the public to confide in his
rep­re­sen­ta­tion), is ever after estopped from denying responsibility
for any injury which may have arisen out of defects
in its quality, or errors in its composition. So long as the
label is attached, it is an affirmation of the good quality of
the article and its correct composition, to every one who
relies upon it when buying. But as some articles deteriorate
in time, what is said in relation to the liability of the
vendor applies only to the article at the time it leaves
<span class="xxpn" id="p180">|180|</span>
his hands. He only warrants its good qualities then,
but no longer, and his rep­re­sen­ta­tion affirms that much,
and no more (<a id="fnanchor-472" href="#fn-472" class="fnanchor">472</a>). The subject of labels was carefully
considered in <i>Thomas</i> v. <i>Winchester</i> (<a id="fnanchor-473" href="#fn-473" class="fnanchor">473</a>), where Ruggles C.J.
gave judgment. Mary Ann Thomas was ordered a dose of
extract of dandelion, her husband bought what he believed
was dandelion from Dr. Foord, druggist and physician;
but it was extract of belladonna. The jar was labelled
‘½ ℔ dandelion, prepared by A. Gilbert, No. 108 John
street, N. Y.’ Foord bought it as dandelion from James
S. Aspinwall, druggist, who bought it from defendant, a
druggist, 108 John street. Defendant manufactured some
drugs and purchased others, but labelled all in the same
way. Gilbert was an assistant who had originally owned
the business. The extract in the jar had been purchased
from another dealer. The two extracts are alike in colour,
consistency, smell and taste. Gilbert’s labels were paid for
by defendant and used in his business with his knowledge
and consent. A non-suit was moved for on the ground, that
defendant being a remote vendor and there being no privity
or connection between him and the plaintiff, the action
could not be sustained. The Court said, “Gilbert, the defendant’s
agent, would have been punishable for manslaughter if
Mrs. Thomas had died in consequence of taking the falsely
labelled medicine. Every one who by his culpable negligence
causes the death of another, although without intent
to kill, is guilty of manslaughter (<a id="fnanchor-474" href="#fn-474" class="fnanchor">474</a>). This rule applies not
only where the death of one is occasioned by the neglectful
act of another, but where it is caused by the neglectful
omission of a duty by that other (<a id="fnanchor-475" href="#fn-475" class="fnanchor">475</a>). Although the defendant
W. may not be answerable criminally for the neglect
<span class="xxpn" id="p181">|181|</span>
of his agent, there can be no doubt as to his liability in a
civil action, in which the action of the agent is to be
regarded as the act of the principal. The defendant’s
neglect put human life in imminent danger. Can it be
said that there was no duty on the part of the defendant
to avoid the creation of that danger by the exercise of
greater caution? Or that the exercise of that caution was a
duty only to his immediate vendee, whose life was not
endangered? (He being a dealer and not a customer.)
The defendant’s duty arose out of the nature of his
business, and the danger to others incident to its
mismanagement. Nothing but mischief like that which
actually happened could have been expected from sending
the poison falsely labelled into the market, and the defendant
is justly responsible for the probable consequences of
the act. The duty of exercising caution in this respect
did not arise out of the defendant’s contract of sale to
Aspinwall. The wrong done by the defendant was in
putting the poison unlabelled into the hands of Aspinwall
as an article of merchandise to be sold, and afterwards used,
as the extract of dandelion by some person then unknown.
The defendant’s contract of sale to Aspinwall does not
excuse the wrong done the plaintiffs. It was part of the
means by which the wrong was effected. The plaintiffs’
injury and their remedy would have stood on the same
principle if the defendant had given the belladonna to Dr.
Foord without price, or if he had put it in his shop without
his knowledge under circumstances that would have led to
its sale on the faith of the labels.”</p>

<p>Ordronaux says (sec. 186): It cannot be denied that
had Mrs. Thomas died, Foord would, equally with Gilbert,
have been guilty of manslaughter, since whether he intended
it or no, he was doing an unlawful act in dispensing a
poison for a salutary medicine. While then it may be
proper enough to rely upon labels and warranties of others,
<span class="xxpn" id="p182">|182|</span>
in dealing with ordinary substances, still when it comes to
articles of a character dangerous to health or life, the law
will presume knowledge of their quality in those professionally
dealing in them, and exact a degree of skill and
care commensurate with the risks incurred. Here it is
<i>caveat venditor</i> instead of <i>caveat emptor</i>.</p>

<p>In Kentucky, a druggist sold croton oil instead of linseed
oil for a patient, who, in consequence of the mistake, died.
His widow was held entitled to full damages against the
seller (<a id="fnanchor-476" href="#fn-476" class="fnanchor">476</a>).</p>

<p>If a druggist negligently sell a deadly poison as and for
a harmless medicine to A., who buys it to administer to B.,
and gives B. a dose of it as a medicine, from the effect of
which he dies, a right of action against the druggist
survives to B.’s representative, not­with­stand­ing the want
of privity of contract between B. and the druggist (<a id="fnanchor-477" href="#fn-477" class="fnanchor">477</a>).
And this is the rule, also, when the sale has been made by
the apothecary’s assistant (<a id="fnanchor-478" href="#fn-478" class="fnanchor">478</a>).</p>

<p>Joseph George, and Emma, his wife, sued Skivington, a
druggist, alleging that he, in the course of his business,
professed to sell a chemical compound made of ingredients
known only to him, and by him represented to be fit for a
hairwash without causing injury to the person that used
it, and to have been carefully compounded by him; that
Joseph thereupon bought of the defendant a bottle of this
hairwash, to be used by Emma, as the defendant knew,
and on the terms that it could be so safely used, and had
been so compounded; yet the defendant had so negligently
and unskilfully conducted himself in preparing and selling
the hairwash, that it was unfit to be used for washing the
hair, whereby the plaintiff, Emma, who used it for that
<span class="xxpn" id="p183">|183|</span>
purpose was injured. The Court held that a good cause of
action was shewn (<a id="fnanchor-479" href="#fn-479" class="fnanchor">479</a>).</p>

<p>A Massachusetts apothecary sold sulphide of antimony
by mistake for black oxide of manganese. The two look
alike, but differ in this, that the preparation of manganese
may be safely mixed with chlorate of potassia for many
useful purposes; but if that antimony is mixed with that
chlorate, an explosive compound is formed. The buyer,
supposing he had manganese, proceeded to mix it with
potassia, having bought the article for that purpose. But,
it being antimony, the compound which he made exploded,
broke his head, damaged his hearing, and destroyed the
furniture of his laboratory. Yet the Court held that the
druggist was not chargeable with these damages, because
he did not know that the article he sold was to be mixed
with potassia, and did not sell it for that purpose. Kept or
used by itself, as he sold it, it would have been innocuous.
He was not to blame for the mixing, the real cause of the
injury (<a id="fnanchor-480" href="#fn-480" class="fnanchor">480</a>).</p>

<p>In England (<a id="fnanchor-481" href="#fn-481" class="fnanchor">481</a>), a chemist and druggist was indicted for
manslaughter, but was acquitted. The deceased had been
in the constant habit of getting aconite and occasionally
henbane from Noakes; on this occasion he sent two bottles
of his own, one marked, “Henbane, 30 drops at a time.”
The druggist by mistake put the aconite into the henbane
bottle, the dose of thirty drops was taken, and the customer
was no more. Erle, C.J., told the jury that although there
might be evidence of negligence sufficient for a civil action,
still that they could not convict unless there was such a
degree of complete negligence as the law meant by the word
“felonious,” and that in this case he did not think there
<span class="xxpn" id="p184">|184|</span>
was sufficient to warrant that. But Tessymond, a chemist’s
apprentice, was found guilty of manslaughter for causing
the death of an infant by negligently giving to a customer
who asked for paregoric to give to the infant (a child of
nine weeks old), a bottle with a paregoric label, but
containing laudanum, and recommending a dose of ten
drops (<a id="fnanchor-482" href="#fn-482" class="fnanchor">482</a>).</p>

<p>One Jones recovered against a chemist and druggist of
the name of Fay, £100 for damages, because he, Fay, gave
him blue pills for the painters’ colic, such physic being
improper (<a id="fnanchor-483" href="#fn-483" class="fnanchor">483</a>). A man, on the advice of a friend, went to a
drug store for ten cents worth of “black-draught,” a
comparatively harmless drug, of which he intended to take
a small glassful as a dose for diarrhœa. There was
evidence given by the clerk who sold the mixture, that at
the shop he asked for “black-drops,” the defendant, the
proprietor, told him that that was poison, that the dose
was from ten to twelve drops, and advised him to take
another mixture; he refused, and the clerk (by the defendant’s
direction), gave him two drachms of “black-drops”
in a bottle, with a label bearing those two words written
upon it, but nothing to indicate the dose, or that it was
poison. The man took the bottle home, drank almost all its
contents, and died the next morning from the effects of so
doing. In an action brought by the representative of the
deceased to recover damages for negligent killing by the
defendant, it was held that the Courts should have submitted
to the jury the question as to whether the defendant
was not guilty of negligence in failing to place upon the
bottle a label, shewing that its contents were poisonous, and
that it erred in non-suiting the plaintiff. Afterwards in
giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Finch, J., said,
“on such a state of facts (as sworn to by the clerk) a verdict
<span class="xxpn" id="p185">|185|</span>
against the defendant would not be justified. Although
no label marked ‘poison’ was put upon the phial, and
granting that by such omission the defendant was guilty of
misdemeanor and liable to the penalty of the criminal law
(under the statute of the State), still that fact does not
make him answerable to the customer injured, or to his
representative in case of his death, for either a negligent
or wrongful act, when towards that customer he was guilty
of neither, since he fairly and fully warned him of all and
more than could have been made known by the authorized
label. *&#160;*&#160;* If the warning was in truth given,
if the deceased was cautioned that the medicine sold was a
strong poison, and but ten or twelve drops must be taken,
he had all the knowledge and all the warning that the
label could have given, and could not disregard it and then
charge the consequences of his own negligent reckless act
upon the seller of the poison. But if no such warning was
given, its omission was negligence, for the results of which
the vendor was liable both at common law and by force of
the statute.” But the Court considered that the clerk
being himself the one who had been negligent stood in a
position to provoke suspicion, arouse doubt and justify
watchful and rigid criticism, and that this joined with the
conduct of the deceased, developed a question of fact rather
than of law, and that the Court below was right in saying
that the case should have been submitted to the jury (<a id="fnanchor-484" href="#fn-484" class="fnanchor">484</a>).</p>

<p>Under the Ontario Pharmacy Act no one can sell certain
poisons named without having the word “Poison,” and the
name of the article, distinctly labelled upon the package;
and if the sale is by retail, the name of the proprietor of
the establishment where it is sold, and the address must
also be on the label (<a id="fnanchor-485" href="#fn-485" class="fnanchor">485</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p186">|186|</span></p>

<p>Any person selling any poison, in violation of the Act, is
liable to a penalty of not more than $20 and costs for the
first offence, and $50 and costs for every subsequent
offence; and one-half of the penalty goes to the prosecutor;
and no one selling in violation of the Act can recover his
charges. And one wilfully or knowingly selling any article
under pretence that it is a particular drug or medicine,
when it is not, is liable to the above penalties, besides any
other to which he may be liable irrespective of the Act (<a id="fnanchor-486" href="#fn-486" class="fnanchor">486</a>).</p>

<p>In Georgia it was held, that where a druggist in good
faith recommended the prescription of another person to
the owner of a sick horse, who thereupon ordered him to
put it up and paid for it, the owner had no cause of action
because the medicine had injured his horse, as the stuff
was properly prepared according to the prescription (<a id="fnanchor-487" href="#fn-487" class="fnanchor">487</a>).</p>

<p>In England chemists and druggists are liable to the
heavy penalty of £500 if they sell to brewers or dealers in
beer anything to be used as a substitute for malt; they are
also liable for adulterating, or selling any adulterated,
medicine; and on a second offence of this kind, the name of
the offender, his abode, and his crime may be published in
the newspapers at his expense (<a id="fnanchor-488" href="#fn-488" class="fnanchor">488</a>).</p>

<p>An action can be maintained by a husband against a
druggist to recover damages for selling to the plaintiff’s wife,
secretly, from day to day large quantities of laudanum to be
used by her as a beverage, and which are so used by her to
the druggist’s knowledge, without the knowledge or consent
of the husband, the druggist well knowing that the same
was injuring and impairing her health, and concealing the
fact of such sales and the use thereof from the husband;
<span class="xxpn" id="p187">|187|</span>
in consequence of which use by her the wife became sick
and emaciated, and her mind was affected, so that she was
unable to perform her duties as such wife, and her affections
became alienated from her husband, and he lost her society,
and was compelled to expend divers sums of money in
medical and other attendance upon her (<a id="fnanchor-489" href="#fn-489" class="fnanchor">489</a>).</p>

<p>In some of the American Courts it has been held that a
statute forbidding the sale or keeping for sale without authority
of spirituous or intoxicating liquors does not apply to
druggists who keep such liquors only for the purpose of mixing
them with other ingredients, according to prescriptions of
physicians; and also for the purpose of manufacturing such
compounds as are commonly used by druggists to be sold
as medicines for remedies for sickness and disease (<a id="fnanchor-490" href="#fn-490" class="fnanchor">490</a>). The
question has often come up whether a compound sold by a
druggist is to be considered an intoxicating liquor, the sale
of which is illegal, or not. The rule laid down is, that so
long as liquors retain their characters as intoxicating
liquors, capable of being used as beverages, not­with­stand­ing
that other ingredients—roots or tinctures—may have been
mixed therewith, they fall under the ban of the law; but
when they are so compounded with other substances as
to lose their distinctive characters of intoxicating liquors,
and are no longer desirable for use as stimulating
beverages, they are medicine and their sale is not prohibited (<a id="fnanchor-491" href="#fn-491" class="fnanchor">491</a>).</p>

<p>In Indiana a <i>bona fide</i> sale of intoxicating liquor by a
druggist for medicinal purposes is not a violation of the
statute regulating the sale of such liquors, although the
statute contains no exception authorizing the sale of such
<span class="xxpn" id="p188">|188|</span>
liquors, without license, for medicinal, chemical or sacramental
purposes.</p>

<p>And that is the law in North Carolina, but not in
Arkansas (<a id="fnanchor-492" href="#fn-492" class="fnanchor">492</a>). In Iowa it was considered a breach of the
law for a druggist to sell a quart of whiskey to a stranger
upon his simple statement that he was accustomed to take
it as a medicine and wanted it as such (<a id="fnanchor-493" href="#fn-493" class="fnanchor">493</a>).</p>

<p>In Texas, where a druggist can only sell ardent spirits
upon the prescription of physicians in sickness, a druggist
who is himself a physician may sell to a sick patient
without a prescription from anyone else (<a id="fnanchor-494" href="#fn-494" class="fnanchor">494</a>).</p>

title="Chapter XV. Partners, Goodwill, Assistants.">CHAPTER XV.
<span class="smallerblk">PARTNERS, GOODWILL, ASSISTANTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A partnership
(<a id="fnanchor-495" href="#fn-495" class="fnanchor">495</a>)
between medical men is an association
of persons, standing to one another in the relation of
principals, for jointly carrying out the objects of their
profession, with an agreement to share the profits.</p>

<p>The general laws relating to partnerships apply to those
of medical men or dentists. There can be no partnership,
as between themselves, if the relationship of master and
servant exists, or where there is no joint interest. No
particular form of words is needed to create a partnership,
nor need the agreement be in writing unless it is to last
for more than a year from the date. If an agreement to
form a partnership is broken an action will lie, if the terms
of the agreement be clear and distinct; but the performance
of such an agreement will not be compelled unless all
the terms have been fixed and ascertained, and a definite
time for its duration agreed on.</p>

<p>If one has been induced to enter the partnership through
the fraud or mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the other, the party
deceived may at his option avoid the contract. But he
should act promptly on discovering the deception. Where
a surgeon was induced to enter into partnership with, and
pay a large premium to another, in consequence of
<span class="xxpn" id="p190">|190|</span>
mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tions as to the amount of income derived from
the practice, a dis­solu­tion was decreed and a return of part
of the premium (<a id="fnanchor-496" href="#fn-496" class="fnanchor">496</a>); and where a practitioner took a partner
and a premium, and agreed to continue practising for three
years, concealing the fact that he was suffering from a
disease which soon carried him off, his executor was ordered
to return part of the premium (<a id="fnanchor-497" href="#fn-497" class="fnanchor">497</a>).</p>

<p>Partners are trustees and agents for one another, and
must exercise the most perfect good faith towards one
another. One cannot sue the other for his share of the
profits until the accounts have been stated and settled
between them. One medical man cannot, as a rule, bind
his partner by borrowing money, even to pay partnership
liabilities, or by making or drawing promissory notes or
bills of exchange; but he may generally do so by simple
contracts, within the scope of the business.</p>

<p>In England, it appears that there is nothing illegal in
the partnership of a qualified and an unqualified practitioner,
and that it will be sufficient if only one member of
the firm be registered (<a id="fnanchor-498" href="#fn-498" class="fnanchor">498</a>).</p>

<p>A partnership may be dissolved by mutual agreement,
or by the effluxion of time. A wilful and permanent
neglect of business is a ground for dissolution; so is gross
misconduct by a partner in reference to partnership matters.
Immoral conduct materially affecting the business
will be a ground for dissolution; also, insanity, or permanent
incapacity (<a id="fnanchor-499" href="#fn-499" class="fnanchor">499</a>). On a dissolution the partners may
separately carry on the business at any place, unless
restrained by agreement.
<span class="xxpn" id="p191">|191|</span></p>

<p>Sir John Leach considered that in a partnership, between
professional persons, upon the death of one partner the
good-will of the business belonged to the survivor, and that
he was not bound to account to the representatives of the
deceased partner for it (<a id="fnanchor-500" href="#fn-500" class="fnanchor">500</a>).</p>

<p>A good-will attaches to a professional, as well as to any
other kind of business, and it is and may be the subject of
purchase and sale; and although it is not computable, and
the sale of it is not enforceable by an action for specific
performance if it has not been estimated, yet it does stand
on the same footing as any other business, if the parties
have fixed a determinate price upon it, or have provided
any other way of fixing its value (<a id="fnanchor-501" href="#fn-501" class="fnanchor">501</a>). The good-will of a
medical man’s business is an asset of his estate which his
representatives can sell, and for which they must account
if it is sold. But it is not clear that the representatives
can be compelled to find a purchaser (<a id="fnanchor-502" href="#fn-502" class="fnanchor">502</a>).</p>

<p>Jessel, M. R., recently asked the question, “What is the
meaning of selling a medical practice?” And in answering
his query he said, “It is the selling of the introduction of
the patients of the doctor who sells to the doctor who buys,
he has nothing else to sell except the introduction. He
can persuade his patients, probably, who have confidence
in him to employ the gentleman he introduces as being a
qualified man, and fit to undertake the cure of their maladies,
but that is all he can do. Therefore, when you talk
of the sale of a non-dispensing medical practice—of course,
when a man keeps what is called a doctor’s shop, there is a
different thing entirely to sell—you are really talking of the
sale of the introduction to the patients, and the length, the
<span class="xxpn" id="p192">|192|</span>
character and duration of the introduction, the terms of the
introduction are everything. And there is something more,
according to my experience, in cases of the sale of medical
practices; there is always a stipulation that the selling
doctor shall retire from practice either altogether or within
a given distance. It is so always, and there is also sometimes
a stipulation that he will not solicit the patients, or
shall not solicit them for a given time. They are both very
important stipulations as regards keeping together the practice
for the purchasing doctor” (<a id="fnanchor-503" href="#fn-503" class="fnanchor">503</a>).</p>

<p>The general rule of law is, that any contract in general
restraint of trade or industry is illegal and void as contrary
to public policy; but such contracts are valid if they operate
merely as a partial restraint, and are made for good consideration,
and not unreasonable. Whether they are
reasonable or not, is for the Court, not the jury, to say.
A contract made with an assistant, or with a partner,
that upon separating from the principal, or partner, he will
not practise within a certain section of country, or for a
certain time, is valid when made in consideration of instruction
to be given, or pecuniary or other benefits to be enjoyed
in consequence of the partnership. The limits must be
reasonable, and when the contract is not to practise within
so many miles of a certain place, the distance will be
measured “as the crow flies,” unless otherwise mentioned (<a id="fnanchor-504" href="#fn-504" class="fnanchor">504</a>).</p>

<p>Covenants, on the part of an assistant to a surgeon and
apothecary, not to practise on his own account for fourteen
years, in a certain town, or within ten miles of the town;
and not at any time to practise within five, seven, ten,
twenty miles of certain places, have been all respectively
<span class="xxpn" id="p193">|193|</span>
held good (<a id="fnanchor-505" href="#fn-505" class="fnanchor">505</a>). The comparative populousness of the district
forbidden ought not to enter into consideration at all;
and an assistant to a dentist was held bound by a covenant
not to practise in London, not­with­stand­ing that city had a
population of over a million (<a id="fnanchor-506" href="#fn-506" class="fnanchor">506</a>). But a stipulation not to
practise within one hundred miles of York, in consideration
of receiving instruction in dentistry, was held void (<a id="fnanchor-507" href="#fn-507" class="fnanchor">507</a>).</p>

<p>A promise, whether verbal or written, made without good
consideration by a medical man not to exercise or carry on
his profession within certain limits is void. The stipulations
in a contract not to practise are divisible, and if part
of them be unreasonable, and therefore illegal and void, the
agreement is not void altogether; and the remaining stipulations,
if valid, will not be affected by the illegality of the
others (<a id="fnanchor-508" href="#fn-508" class="fnanchor">508</a>).</p>

<p>The relations of medical men to their apprentices, assistants
and pupils, are, as a rule, regulated by the ordinary
law of master and servant. No particular words are needed
to create the relationship of master and apprentice, or
master and assistant, the intention of the parties will be
considered, nor need the agreement be in writing, unless it
is not to be performed within a year from the making
thereof (<a id="fnanchor-509" href="#fn-509" class="fnanchor">509</a>). A master is liable on contracts entered into by
his apprentice or assistant, when he has authorized him to
enter into any such contract, either expressly, or by implication.
For instance, if an assistant usually orders drugs
<span class="xxpn" id="p194">|194|</span>
on credit, and the master usually pays, the master will be
held liable to pay for any goods of a similar nature which
the assistant may get for his own and not his master’s use (<a id="fnanchor-510" href="#fn-510" class="fnanchor">510</a>).
The master is also, as a rule, liable to a civil action for the
wrongful acts of his assistant, unless they be beyond the
ordinary scope of his employment; the plaintiff, however,
must prove that the injury was produced by want of proper
skill, where the act complained of is said to have arisen
through want of skill (<a id="fnanchor-511" href="#fn-511" class="fnanchor">511</a>). But the master will not be
criminally responsible for the acts of his assistant or
apprentice, if the latter has caused the death of any one,
unless, indeed, he has expressly commanded or taken part
in the acts (<a id="fnanchor-512" href="#fn-512" class="fnanchor">512</a>). In a case of criminal negligence, the
apprentice himself is responsible; if a party is guilty of
negligence, and death results, the party guilty of that
negligence is also guilty of manslaughter.</p>

<p>An apprentice, or pupil, cannot be dismissed in as summary
a way as an ordinary servant for misconduct. In one
case it was held that though a person has a right to dismiss
a servant for misconduct, still he has no right to turn away
an apprentice because he misbehaves; and that the case of
a young man, say of seventeen, who under a written
agreement, is placed with a medical man as “pupil and
assistant,” and with whom a premium is paid, is a case
between that of apprenticeship and service; and if such an
one on some occasions comes home intoxicated, this alone
will not justify the surgeon in dismissing him. But if the
“pupil and assistant,” by employing the shop boy to compound
the medicines, occasions real danger to the surgeon’s
practice, this would justify the surgeon in dismissing him
(<a id="fnanchor-513" href="#fn-513" class="fnanchor">513</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p195">|195|</span></p>

<p>Pupils and others admitted to hear the lectures of medical
men, whether such lectures are delivered <i>ex-tempore</i>, or
from memory, or from notes, although they may go
to the extent, if they are able to do so, of taking down the
whole by means of shorthand, can do so only for the
purposes of their own information, and cannot publish the
lectures for profit without the consent of the lecturer
(<a id="fnanchor-514" href="#fn-514" class="fnanchor">514</a>).</p>

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p class="first">Original printed spelling and grammar are retained, with a few
exceptions noted below. The corrections suggested in the CORRIGENDA have
been applied. Original printed page numbers look like this:
“|81|”. Footnotes were changed to endnotes, and renumbered 1–514. One
common printer’s error has been corrected silently; fairly often a
short word such as “a” was printed twice on successive lines. Thus, for
example, a sentence on page 99 originally read “And a a very recent
writer says .&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.”</p>

<p class="pleft">In the index, ditto marks and white space were used in combination to
indicate words repeated from line to line. In this edition, em dashes
are used instead. Thus the <a href="#p198a">line</a> beginning “Provision made for study
of, in England”, was printed with two ditto marks and white space
sufficient to indicate the first five words repeated; herein rendered
“—&#160;&#160;—&#160;&#160;—&#160;&#160;—&#160;&#160;— in Canada”.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
